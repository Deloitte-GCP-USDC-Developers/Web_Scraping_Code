b'Acer Aspire 5 (2019)',b'Laptops',CNET,b'Acer Aspire 5 (2019) review: An incredible thin-and-light laptop deal',"b""There are two types of laptops I've come to expect from Acer: Standout premium models like the crazy Swift 7 ultraportable and Predator Triton 900, and mainstream laptops that are impossibly good deals -- like last year's Predator Helios 300 and this year's Acer Aspire 5. For more than a year, Acer's Aspire E 15 was my go-to pick for anyone who just needed a quick, reliable laptop for general use around the home. Sadly, that model is getting harder to find, but the Aspire 5 is an excellent alternative that's thinner, lighter and still an impossibly good deal.\xc2\xa0""b""Starting at $400\xc2\xa0with an Intel processor or $350 with an AMD chip, the 15.6-inch Aspire 5 is only 3.8 pounds (1.7 kg) and 0.7 inch thick (18 mm). That combination of size, weight and price, isn't easy to find with a 15.6-inch display. By comparison, the Acer E 15 had the same screen size, but was more than 5 pounds (2.4 kg) and just over an inch thick (30 mm). It also started at roughly the same price and was similarly configured. You do lose things like an SD card reader, a VGA display output and a DVD drive, but chances are it's only the card reader that matters to more people at this point, if anything.\xc2\xa0""b""The $530 configuration I tested, the A515-54-51DJ, bumps that base model's processor from a dual-core Intel Core i3 to a quad-core i5, and doubles the memory to 8GB and storage to 256GB -- well worth the extra money. And, if you're able to spend about $100 more, you can get it with a new 10th-gen Core i5, entry-level Nvidia MX250 discrete graphics and a 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD. That's a lot of performance for everything from day-to-day basics to simple photo and video editing to gaming on low to medium settings.\xc2\xa0""b""Like any budget-friendly laptop worth its salt, Acer puts most of your money toward good internal components and not into things like an all-metal chassis or an ultrabright high-res touchscreen. For example, my Aspire 5 had a similar configuration to Lenovo's premium Yoga C930 two-in-one. Performance is about the same between the two but the Yoga is twice the price. What's more, you can pop the Aspire's bottom off and add more memory or increase storage on your own, something fewer and fewer premium models will let you do.""b""The Acer is mostly plastic, though it's capped with a thin sheet of aluminum to class it up a bit. Unfortunately mine ended up with a slight dent at the top of the display, which also made it a little too easy to peel the bezel off from around the screen (it snaps right back into place). That's not likely to happen on a pricier model, but hey, it does make the Aspire more serviceable at least. My point is, the build quality is fine for what you're paying, but don't expect the durability of a premium laptop.\xc2\xa0""b'No SD card slot, but plenty of other connection options.\xc2\xa0'b""Around the sides you'll find several ports that are disappearing and being replaced with USB-C ports on other models. While there is one USB-C, it isn't Thunderbolt 3, but a\xc2\xa0USB 3.1 Gen 1 port. You'll also find:""b""With this setup, you could easily load it up with a full-size keyboard and mouse, an external display and other essentials to use this as a desktop replacement. That's not to say the keyboard, touchpad and display need to be replaced -- they're fine, all things considered -- just that it can handle life on a desk as well as unplugged around the house. It has battery life to back it up, too, hitting 8 hours, 38 minutes on our streaming video test.\xc2\xa0""b""The full-HD IPS display has pleasing color and brightness, it looks fine off-angle and the matte finish helps tame distracting reflections. The backlit keyboard feels a little soft, but the keys have a decent pop to them and enough travel so you don't feel like you're typing on a tabletop (or a MacBook). The Windows Precision touchpad works well, too, and you even get a fingerprint reader built into it. Still, you might want to adjust the touchpad sensitivity to prevent your palm from accidentally moving the cursor.\xc2\xa0""b""The Acer Aspire 5 is a 15.6-inch thin-and-light that definitely delivers more performance for your money than you might expect. Though it starts low, the $530 configuration I tested is a comfortable middle ground that's full-featured enough for typical work, home and school tasks. But even if you decide to go all out on upgrades, this model doesn't break the $900 mark and you'll get a workhorse laptop that won't win any beauty contests, but should last you well into the future.\xc2\xa0""",8.0,b'Joshua Goldman',"Nov. 16, 2019 4:00 a.m. PT"
b'HP Stream 14',b'Laptops',CNET,"b""HP Stream 14 review:\xc2\xa0This laptop's best feature is its rock-bottom price""","b""A low price on a laptop can make up for a lot of shortcomings. That is, as long as those shortcomings don't interfere with you getting stuff done.""b""The 14-inch HP Stream, for example, is only $220 in the US and \xc2\xa3200 in the UK. As long as your needs don't leap too far beyond watching YouTube clips, sending email and using web apps, you're golden. (HP doesn't offer the Stream in a 14-inch size in Australia, but there is the HP 14-am034tu for AU$500, which is similarly configured, but with a 500GB hard drive instead of a 32GB eMMC.)""b""The 14-inch body is thin and it's light at about 3 pounds (1.4 kg), but if you were hoping for something smaller, HP makes an 11.6-inch Stream for $20 less. It has the same internal components as the 14, but has one less USB 3.1 port and a microSD card slot instead of the 14's full-size slot. ""b""The Stream is a nice-looking laptop, too, assuming you're cool with the bright blue color. It's all plastic with ridges on the lid that give it texture and added grip. The blue continues inside except for the bright white keyboard.""b'Plenty of ports for peripherals.'b""With its meager 32GB of storage -- only about half of which is available to use -- it's nice HP didn't skimp on expansion options. An SD card fits almost entirely in the slot, too, so you could easily leave a card in there for files and applications. ""b""You can, of course, use those ports for a keyboard and mouse to avoid the laptop's touchpad and keyboard. The latter isn't altogether unpleasant, but there's very little travel and the keys feel thin and flimsy like they might pop off or stop working if you type too hard. The touchpad is generally OK, but I recommend shutting off most of the multitouch options like pinch-to-zoom and turning up the palm rejection setting. ""b""If you're hooking up a keyboard and mouse, though, you might as well connect a monitor as well. The laptop's screen looks washed out, colors are off and I found myself constantly adjusting the angle in a futile attempt to make it look better. You know what worked? Outputting to a full HD display via HDMI. """,7.1,b'Joshua Goldman',"Dec. 10, 2016 4:45 a.m. PT"
b'Dell XPS 13 9370',b'Laptops',CNET,b'Dell XPS 13 review: Tiny tweaks to a long-time favorite',"b'Having watched the Dell XPS 13 evolve over the past several years, I really thought we had reached the end of the line in terms of possible improvements. The 2019 version had a super-slim bezel, good performance at a decent price, 4K screen options, and was more of a major step forward, solving a long-time engineering problem by putting a super-tiny webcam up on top of the screen, instead of underneath it.\xc2\xa0'b""And while I could no longer make jokes about the infamous up-the-nose webcam shot, I pretty much didn't have any major design complaints about the system anymore. So, where do you go from there?\xc2\xa0""b'You start by tweaking the screen, shaving down that bezel a tiny bit more and shaping the lid, so you can fit a 13.4-inch display in there, instead of a 13.3-inch one. That sounds like a pretty tiny tweak, and it is, but I like that it now has a very modern-feeling 16:10 aspect ratio screen. Not quite as TV-like as the 16:9 ones almost everywhere else.\xc2\xa0'b""The body has lost a few fractions of a millimeter, too, with a slightly smaller footprint. But the smaller body also means it feels dense when you pick it up, and slightly heavier than you expect, even though it actually weighs the same 1 pound, 13 ounces as the latest MacBook Air (without power bricks, and going by the exact test configurations I had of each). The larger footprint of the MacBook makes the weight feel more evenly distributed, but it also takes up slightly more space on your desk, so there's a trade-off.\xc2\xa0""b""Now that's a slim bezel.""b""The amazing screen-to-body ratio on the XPS 13 is a real eye-catching selling point here. For some people, the white woven glass palm rest area -- a $50 upsell over black carbon fiber --\xc2\xa0 is also a big attraction. I never thought the white palmrest and aluminum lower body felt part of an organic whole, the way some other laptops feel like they're carved from a single slab of metal (even if they're not). But my son -- hey, we're all working from home offices now, remember? -- looked at both the new XPS 13 and new MacBook Air side by side and declared the XPS to be much fancier.\xc2\xa0""b""In some ways, the new XPS 13 has the bad luck to arrive right around the same time as the new Apple MacBook Air, a similarly priced 13-inch laptop that covers a lot of the same ground. The new MacBook Air upgraded itself by moving to a new keyboard style, closer in fact to what's on the XPS 13. It also jumped to quad-core 10th-gen Core i5 CPUs, again, also offered in the XPS 13.\xc2\xa0""b'Beats a butterfly keyboard any day...\xc2\xa0'b""These two are similar in so many ways, including some confusing pricing options to dig through. Both were originally pitched as starting at $999 in the US. The MacBook Air has indeed moved back to $999, but that drops you down to a dual-core Intel Core i3 CPU, which doesn't sound like a $1,000 part to me. The new XPS 13, as originally noted during its CES 2020 rollout, started at $999 with -- yes -- a Core i3 CPU. But as of this writing, I'm seeing $1,249 as the least-expensive option (older models are still available for significantly less) on Dell's website. That gets you a new Core i5 with Intel Iris graphics, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, similar to the specs on a $1,099 2020 MacBook Air (which also has a higher-resolution screen).\xc2\xa0""b'My test unit was well-equipped, with a Core i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD and a 1,920x,1,080 touchscreen display, for $1,749. To be fair, Apple did the same, sending me a higher-end Core i7/16GB/512GB build that costs $1,649.\xc2\xa0'b""While the XPS 13 originally felt like the best 13-inch Windows laptop to get if you wanted a MacBook-Air-like experience, but for whatever reason needed to run Windows instead of MacOS. But it's long since evolved past that. The component specs may match up pretty well, but the XPS is also full of pleasant subtle surprises.\xc2\xa0""b'The two USB-C ports (which are also full Thunderbolt 3 ports) are split up, one on each side, giving you more options for plugging in power or accessories. The MacBook Air shoves both on one side, leaving you less flexibility. The XPS 13 also includes a microSD card reader, a rare inclusion in a world where PC makers are racing to shed ports as quickly as possible.\xc2\xa0'b""And finally, you can't beat that nearly edge-to-edge screen. Next to it, the MacBook's display bezels look huge. Even with the 1,920x1,080 option, the 500-nit display looks great. Yes, there's a 4K option, for $200 more than the FHD touchscreen, but on a screen this size that feels like overkill, and would no doubt knock several hours off the impressive 11-hour-and-26-minute battery life we got for the XPS 13 in our video-streaming battery life test.\xc2\xa0""b'Some premium Windows laptops focus on cutting weight, like the LG Gram, or size, like the Acer Swift 7, but Dell has managed to make some subtle improvements to a proven winner and maintain its title as one of the best all-around general-purpose 13-inch Windows laptops you can buy.'",8.5,b'Dan Ackerman',"March 28, 2020 4:01 a.m. PT"
b'Apple MacBook Air 2020',b'Laptops',CNET,b'Magic Keyboard makes the new $999 MacBook Air',"b""Take a 2019 13-inch MacBook Air. Now take the brand-new 2020 version. Put them next to each other and try to tell the two apart. You can't; they're identical. Until, that is, you open both lids. It's a subtle thing, but if you look closely there's a new look and feel to the keyboard. The flat, island-style keyboard is slightly raised on the new model versus the older one.\xc2\xa0""b""That's because this is Apple's Magic Keyboard, a design first seen in the 2019\xc2\xa016-inch MacBook Pro\xc2\xa0and based on the standalone Magic Keyboard for the\xc2\xa0iMac ($1,899 at Back Market). It's a big improvement on the long-suffering butterfly keyboard found in most Macs in recent years, which has been plagued by breakdowns and general consumer dissatisfaction.\xc2\xa0""b""More than anything else, the new Magic Keyboard is what makes the latest Air such a winner. Yes, it solves a problem largely of Apple's own making, but the end result is highly satisfying, especially when coupled with new $999 starting price and component changes, which is why I consider it worthy of an Editors' Choice nod, with the caveat that there's a specific configuration that represents the best overall value.\xc2\xa0""b""The new keyboard isn't the only interesting new thing about the new MacBook Air. Also big news is that the laptop finally officially returns to the classic $999 (\xc2\xa3999, AU$1,599) price, after a few years of starting at $1,199 and then $1,099 (although some retailers would regularly discount it by $100 or so).\xc2\xa0""b'There is, however, a bit of a catch. That $999 starting price only includes an Intel Core i3 CPU, not the Core i5 one would expect for that price. Beyond that one issue, most of the other news is good. New CPUs upgrade options include quad-core Intel 10th-gen chips. The default storage jumps from a measly 128GB to a more reasonable 256GB. Intel Iris graphics are a step up without adding extra hardware from AMD or Nvidia.\xc2\xa0'b'There was once a time I called the 13-inch Apple MacBook Air ""the most universally useful laptop you can buy."" That was back when the Air was a very college-student-friendly $999 and clearly outclassed anything in the Windows world you could get for the same price. Others might have matched or beat its processor speeds, but the Air had a slim, unibody aluminum shell, a near-perfect keyboard and an OS that wouldn\'t drive you (quite as) crazy.'b'But that was a long time ago. Over the years, the MacBook Air\xc2\xa0fell behind the competition, stubbornly clinging to its design and even most of its specs as other laptops evolved. In 2018, the system finally got a\xc2\xa0much-needed reboot, adding a high-res screen, slimmer bezels and Touch ID. But at the same time, it also added the much-maligned butterfly keyboard and kicked the price up. \xc2\xa0I always felt that was a mistake -- $999 is an important psychological and financial barrier, especially for students, writers and anyone who needs maximum reliability and usability on a budget.\xc2\xa0'b""Now that I've had a chance to go hands-on with the new MacBook Air, the keyboard really stands out as a major selling point. The keys sit visibly higher. They feel more substantial. There's a satisfying heft to typing, and unlike the previous version you'll never wonder if a keystroke registered. It's hard to overstate how big a change this is when using the two MacBook Air keyboards side by side.\xc2\xa0""b'The butterfly keyboard on the left, versus the new Magic Keyboard on the right.\xc2\xa0'b""And it's about time. Apple had stuck with its long-suffering butterfly keyboard design far past anyone thought it would. That super-flat style was introduced in the\xc2\xa0late, great 2015 12-inch MacBook\xc2\xa0(a misunderstood classic I will defend until the end of time). That said, everyone pretty much hated the keyboard even as it crept across the product line, into the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro ($900 at Back Market) models.\xc2\xa0""b'The butterfly keyboard underwent several small revisions over the years, never quite making everyone happy (and gaining a reputation for stuck keys and other malfunctions), even if the\xc2\xa0keyboard hatred was, frankly, overblown.\xc2\xa0'b'Then along came the 16-inch MacBook Pro in late 2019. Not only did it make a major move by killing the long-standing 15-inch MacBook Pro screen, leaving Apple without a 15-inch laptop, it pulled the plug on the butterfly keyboard, replacing it with a similarly flat design that had a much better mechanism underneath. At the time, I said ""After just a single day of typing on the new Magic-style keyboard on the 16-inch MacBook Pro, I\'m ready to\xc2\xa0retcon\xc2\xa0the butterfly keyboard back to being a disaster. That\'s because the new keyboard is positively delightful, which is not praise I offer lightly. Put another way, my first thought early this morning while typing this review on the 16-inch Pro was, ""Where the f*** has this been for the last four years?""\xc2\xa0'b""Now, that same updated keyboard is in the MacBook Air. No, Apple didn't blow out the screen bezels even more and force in a 14-inch screen, although that would have been interesting to see. Maybe that's waiting for the inevitable upgrade to the 13-inch MacBook Pro, which is now the odd-man-out and least-updated of the MacBook line.\xc2\xa0""b""One of the things really holding back both budget laptops and the non-budget MacBook Air has been small storage drives. The Air, even in its 2018 refresh (and at a premium $1,199 starting price), included only a 128GB solid state drive. With OS overhead, maybe some games, apps like Photoshop and Illustrator and how high-res photos and videos are these days, that's really not enough.\xc2\xa0""b""Unless you're a gamer or video editor, no one really needs 1TB or larger drives, but 256GB is really the new normal, especially if you don't want to feel like you're micromanaging storage all the time. The jump from 128GB to 256GB in the base $999 MacBook Air is welcome, if overdue. The $1,299 step-up version gets 512GB as its default. In both cases, 8GB is the standard RAM, which works only because of how efficiently MacOS deals with it, but really, the 16GB step-up should be the new normal, not a $200 upgrade.\xc2\xa0""b""At least you can upgrade that, unlike the 720p webcam, which feels stuck in time and keeps this from being a truly pro-level business machine, although that's a problem that plagues the entire MacBook line. Below are images captured moments apart with the 2019 and 2020 versions of the MacBook Air. Especially in a (hopefully temporary) era of endless Zoom meetings, it's a shortcoming.\xc2\xa0""b""Read more:\xc2\xa0Apple's new 2020 MacBook Air left out a key upgrade for people working from home""b'The 2019 version webcam.\xc2\xa0'b'The 2020 version webcam.'b""More storage, better keyboard, new CPUs, better graphics. All welcome upgrades. The claim that the Air now has 10th-gen Intel quad-core processors is also welcome, but read the not-so-fine print. The $999 version comes with a dual-core Intel Core i3, which doesn't sound, at least on paper, like a very premium experience. After all, a Core i3 is what you get in cheap Black Friday doorbuster laptops.\xc2\xa0""b""The review unit I've been using is the upgraded Core i5 version, and in initial work-from-home testing, I found it to be roughly on-par with current Windows Core i5 laptops, but seriously lagging some recent Core i7 models, like the new Dell XPS 13 we just tested. Battery life was 9:40 on our streaming video battery drain test, which is a little behind Apple's claims, but good enough for all-day, every day use.\xc2\xa0""b""I have not tested the cheaper Core i3 base model, but I'm sure it's fine for everyday office or student tasks, even some modest graphic design and photo editing. But I do cringe a bit at paying a thousand bucks for a Core i3 CPU.\xc2\xa0""b""Jumping to the quad-core Core i5 is an extra $100, which seems like a smart investment. But then I'd want the 16GB of RAM as well, for another $200. At that point, you should look at the higher-end base model, which starts at $1,299 for the quad-core Core i5 and jumps to 512GB of storage, but again with just 8GB of RAM. So, add $200 to that and you're up to $1,499. At which point you might as well wait for the inevitable 13-inch MacBook Pro update. [Update:\xc2\xa0The 13-inch MacBook Pro has been updated with 10th-gen Intel CPUs and the new Magic Keyboard]""b""But no -- that's what the obsessive upgrade monster in your head wants you to do. Start with the $999 base model, add $100 for the quad-core upgrade. Based on the on-paper specs and what we've tested so far, that's what you should do.\xc2\xa0""",8.6,b'Dan Ackerman',"March 29, 2020 6:32 a.m. PT"
"b'Acer Swift 3 (14-inch, 2020)'",b'Laptops',CNET,"b'Acer Swift 3 (14-inch, 2020) review: A featherweight laptop with performance to spare at a fair price'","b""The 14-inch Acer Swift 3 is powered by AMD's Ryzen 4000 series mobile processors. This might not mean much to you unless you follow the world of mobile processors, but basically these AMD chips are faster than the competing Intel CPUs that rule the market -- and they cost less. That means models like the Swift 3 stay affordable but get you the processor performance of a pricier laptop.\xc2\xa0""b""But just because the processor delivers the speed of a more expensive laptop, doesn't suddenly make everything else about the 14-inch Swift 3 as amazing. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty to like about it.\xc2\xa0 For example, at 2.7 pounds (1.2 kg), it's incredibly light for a 14-inch laptop at its $620 starting price. It has an aluminum and aluminum-magnesium body, a backlit keyboard and a responsive fingerprint reader for quick sign-ins. Its Wi-Fi 6 gives you a little wireless future-proofing. And while its battery life is good -- it got just about eight hours in my testing -- it can be quickly charged with the included barrel-style adapter or through its USB-C port.\xc2\xa0""b'A power jack, USB-C and USB-A ports and an HDMI output line the left side. Another USB-A port and a headphone jack are on the right side.\xc2\xa0'b""Frankly, while the eight-core Ryzen 7 4700U's performance is uncannily good, so is the six-core  Ryzen 5 4500U found in other Swift 3 configurations for less money. (Check out the benchmark test results at the end of the review.) All of the current configurations for the 14-inch version (there is an Intel-based 13.5-inch model) have the same full-HD-resolution display, the same chassis, ports, keyboard, touchpad and the same 8GB of memory; the only things that change are storage and processor.\xc2\xa0""b""If you're just in need of a good laptop for basic school or office work, I'd go with the Swift 3 SF314-42-R0HP, which is currently available for $579. It has the Ryzen 5 that's still faster than competing Intel chips. It also has half the storage, too, but you can upgrade that on your own later on if needed. The RAM is soldered on, however, leaving you stuck with the 8GB it comes with. But, again, that doesn't change regardless of the configuration you buy.\xc2\xa0""b'The display is a potential weak spot for the 14-inch Swift 3.\xc2\xa0'b""The 14-inch display stays the same across this version and it's not extraordinary but it's fine, which is what I would expect considering the rest of the package. It doesn't get especially bright, so while I had no issues using it indoors, you might struggle to see it outdoors (that can be said about a lot of laptops, though). It has a matte finish, which minimizes reflections far more than a glossy coating, though it can also make colors look flat by comparison. I wouldn't recommend this for critical mobile photo or video editing anyway; there are better options for that and you can expect to pay more than $650.\xc2\xa0""b""The star of the Acer Swift 3 is certainly the processor. It's more performance than you'd get in the past for the money. But what makes this laptop an easy recommendation is that you're getting that speed plus good battery life and in a 2.7-pound aluminum body at a fair price.\xc2\xa0""",8.0,b'Joshua Goldman',"July 27, 2020 4:00 a.m. PT"
b'Lenovo Yoga C940 (14-inch)',b'Laptops',CNET,b'Lenovo Yoga C940 (14-inch) review: A little extra screen and a lot to like',"b""If you've ever reached for your phone instead of your laptop simply because it's faster to wake up, unlock and start working, you'll appreciate what Lenovo's Yoga C940 can do. The company's flagship 14-inch two-in-one is an\xc2\xa0Intel Project Athena device, a select group of\xc2\xa0laptops co-engineered with Intel to perform more like your phone. While I never felt like its predecessor, the C930, was slow, it's surprising how responsive the C940 feels by comparison.""b""Lift the lid and it instantly wakes from sleep. The fingerprint reader unlocks the C940 in a second and since the Wi-Fi connects just as fast, it's essentially ready to work immediately. With the laptop asleep and lid open, you only have to put your fingertip down on the reader and it's awake and unlocked as fast as your phone.\xc2\xa0""b""The C940's 1080p display is better for battery life and fine for productivity.\xc2\xa0""b""The heart of the C940 is its 10th-gen Intel Core i7 processor with the chip maker's Ice Lake architecture. We've been impressed with its performance in other two-in-ones including the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 and HP's Spectre x360 13 (both of these are Project Athena certified, too). The Intel Iris Plus graphics that accompany the processor actually has more bite than you might expect as it's able to chew through more demanding tasks and even do a little light gaming. It's no replacement for discrete graphics (you can bump up to the 15.6-inch C940 if you want that), but it's better than the integrated Intel UHD Graphics chip found in the C930.\xc2\xa0""b'Long battery life and fast charging are also part of the package. I got to test both the full-HD (1,920x1,080 pixels) and ultra-HD (3,840x2,160 pixels) displays Lenovo offers for the C940. If you care about battery life most, get the FHD display, which lasted for 11 hours and 15 minutes on our streaming video test.\xc2\xa0'b""Maxed out brightness: the C940's UHD display (left) vs. the C940's FHD display.\xc2\xa0""b""The UHD display model ran for 8 hours and 15 minutes, which is still good given the increased power demands. It is a nicer display, too, with better color and brightness that tops 400 nits and it's VESA-certified DisplayHDR 400. That said, they can both stand to be calibrated out of the box and the glossy coating will have you fighting reflections outside. Regardless of which you go with, I have to say I like having the slightly larger 14-inch display size compared to the 13.3- and 13.4-inch screens of the HP and Dell.\xc2\xa0""b'The Yoga C940 sticks closely to the winning design of the C930, but Lenovo still found ways to improve it. For example, it has the same reverse-notch design at the top of the display as its clamshell counterpart, the S940. It makes it easier to lift the lid with one finger while also making room for the webcam and its sliding privacy shutter.\xc2\xa0'b""Lenovo made its unique soundbar hinge a single piece that gives it a cleaner look and better audio than the competition. And it doesn't matter what position you're using the C940 in, either. One other small change: Lenovo made it easier to remove the included active pen from the garage on the back of the laptop by cutting a notch into the body.\xc2\xa0""b""All the C940's ports are on the left side.\xc2\xa0""b'One thing I wish Lenovo would change is the port placement. All of its ports -- two USB-C Thunderbolt 3, one USB-A and a headphone jack -- are on the left side. If Lenovo moved one of the Thunderbolt 3s to the other side, you could charge the laptop from the left or right and it could leave more room for connecting bulkier USB devices, such as a memory card reader or flash drive.\xc2\xa0'b""Also worth mentioning is that the memory is soldered onto the mainboard. That's pretty standard for ultraportables now, though. Basically just make sure you get all the memory you think you'll need upfront.\xc2\xa0""b""The Lenovo Yoga C940 is an excellent premium two-in-one, especially if you're looking for a bit more screen space than Dell's XPS 13 or the HP Spectre x360.

b'HP Spectre x360 13 (late 2019)',b'Laptops',CNET,b'HP Spectre x360 13 (2019) review: An incredible shrinking 2-in-1',"b""With premium laptops and two-in-ones like the 13-inch HP Spectre x360, it's almost a given that the newest model will be smaller and thinner than its predecessor. I have to say, though, when I saw the old and new x360 side by side, the size difference was shocking. The updated design eliminates almost all of the top and bottom bezels -- the forehead and chin -- allowing it to greatly reduce the overall footprint of something that was already pretty small to begin with. It looks amazing.\xc2\xa0   ""b""What's more, even at a smaller size, the x360 running a 10th-gen Intel Core i7 managed to handily outperform the last-gen model running a similar configuration with an Intel eighth-gen CPU. It also has a battery that kept it running for more than 10 hours in our tests. Combined with other helpful features and a refined design, the 2019 HP Spectre x360 13 is our current top premium two-in-one.\xc2\xa0   ""b'Old vs. new: The newest Spectre x360 13 (right) is significantly smaller than its predecessor (left).'b""Like last year's model, the new x360 has angular gem-cut edges and cutaway corners that help it stand out from other premium ultraportables, but also improve functionality. The cutaway corners on the back edge are where you'll find the power button and one of the laptop's two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports. Since it charges via USB-C, the angled port allows you to charge the x360 while keeping the cord out of the way for using a mouse, for example.\xc2\xa0   ""b""The power button's position on the left corner makes it easy to find without looking and easy to avoid accidentally pressing in tablet mode. The button is also accessible regardless of how the display is positioned. Also, the dual-chamfer edges make it easier to grip and open the x360 from the front or sides.\xc2\xa0   ""b""The body's left side has a drop-down USB-A port and headphone jack, while on the right side, along with a microSD card slot and a second Thunderbolt 3 port, you'll find a kill switch for the webcam -- no more Post-it notes to keep your camera private. That's joined by a mic mute button on the keyboard, so you no longer need to dig into\xc2\xa0Windows 10's microphone privacy settings\xc2\xa0to shut those down. For additional\xc2\xa0privacy\xc2\xa0and security, there's a fingerprint reader and, according to HP, the world's smallest IR webcam for facial recognition sign-ins with Windows Hello. This basically one-ups Dell's world's smallest regular webcam on its XPS 13 2-in-1.\xc2\xa0   ""b""As for the display, I tested the 1,920x1,080-resolution panel, but there's also a 4K UHD (3,840x2,160) OLED display option that is factory color-calibrated. For productivity use, the full-HD display delivers good color and contrast, and brightness is improved for better outdoor use.\xc2\xa0   ""b""Wide keycaps help with the keyboard's comfort.\xc2\xa0""b""The keyboard is essentially unchanged from the last model, which is great news. It's spacious and has big, easy-to-read markings. The keys have a fair amount of travel considering how shallow the laptop deck is and noticeably more than the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1. The keyboard is backlit, too, with two brightness levels, and automatically shuts off after about 30 seconds of inactivity and needs a key press to wake it up. The Windows Precision touchpad is a comfortable size considering the space HP had to work with and performance is smooth and responsive.\xc2\xa0     ""b""Premium ultraportables are the way to go if you want long battery life. They regularly hit more than 10 hours in our streaming video battery test and some do better -- like the last-gen Spectre x360, which blew right past that, landing at 13 hours, 18 minutes. This new version didn't last quite as long on its slightly smaller battery, but was still impressive at 10 hours, 39 minutes. That's in line with the battery life HP reports for its streaming video tests. For local video playback over headphones, HP says this Spectre can run for a touch over 20 hours.\xc2\xa0   ""b'HP includes a basic active pen and sleeve with the x360. A pen with tilt control is also available.\xc2\xa0'b""The Spectre's components are geared for average home and office uses like word processing, web browsing and email, but with enough muscle to push through more demanding work, including stuff that's more graphics-intensive thanks to its Intel Iris Pro chip.\xc2\xa0   ""b""The configuration I tested didn't get bogged down with a dozen tabs open in Google Chrome while other applications ran in the background. Streaming video and music were no problem either. And it'll handle more demanding photo- and video-editing tasks than Intel's UHD Graphics 620 and even a some low-end gaming (yes, it'll run Fortnite).   ""b'The USB-C port on the corner keeps the charging cable out of the way.\xc2\xa0'b""When I wrapped up my review of Dell's XPS 13 2-in-1 I said it was the ultraportable two-in-one to beat. The HP, in my opinion, beats it, but not by much. It's similar in size to the Dell and has an equally elegant design. While the XPS edges out the HP in our benchmarks, it's likely due to the Dell we tested having 16GB of memory to the HP's 8GB. Regardless, the numbers aren't drastically different, and the HP had a slightly longer battery life.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0   ""b""The HP edged out the Dell with features like the discrete webcam kill switch and mic mute button, including an active pen, having both a fingerprint reader and IR camera for sign-ins and a more comfortable keyboard, though that last thing is open for debate. You can also get it with 4G LTE mobile wireless, something Dell doesn't offer.\xc2\xa0   ""b""While there is the minor annoyance of having a bunch of software from HP and others preinstalled on this premium machine and you can't add more memory on your own, the overall package is just a bit better than the Dell in the end.\xc2\xa0   """,9.0,b'Joshua Goldman',"Dec. 5, 2019 4:00 a.m. PT"
b'Asus ProArt StudioBook One',b'Laptops',CNET,"b""Asus ProArt StudioBook One review: For every pro, there's a con""","b""Asus, the company that brought you the hinge with a lift, stands that idea on its head -- or really its lid -- for the ProArt StudioBook One. It's a high-ranking member of Asus' creator-focused laptop line, designed for professionals who need workstation graphics. The StudioBook One opens a gap behind the screen when you lift the lid, increasing the amount of cool air the fans can suck in from the bottom and sides without requiring big, unsightly vents.  ""b""After I finished hyperventilating because I thought I'd broken the $10,000 system, I found the design pretty clever. The notebook's components sit behind the display rather than underneath the keyboard, much like in an all-in-one desktop such as the iMac. Sadly, I won't have it long enough to figure out if it will have problems with the airflow due to cat hair ingestion.""b'Mind the ventilation gap.'b""It's a good thing the laptop has that gap, because it's armed with some grisly heat generators. It incorporates the new Nvidia Quadro RTX 6000 work graphics processor, the workstation equivalent of a GeForce RTX 2080 Super, and an excellent Pantone Validated, 120Hz Adobe RGB 4K screen. Putting them in the display section means it won't burn your lap or your fingers.""b""The catch is where the hot air's vented: Through a gap above the screen, aimed right at your face. It doesn't blow the air out forcefully, so it's not like it blasts you with a sirocco, but it is noticeable. Heat needs to be dissipated somehow, so choose your lesser evil.""b'This is where the hot air comes out.'b""Because the components are in the lid, the connectors -- three Thunderbolt 3 ports as well as the power -- are there, too. On one hand, it's nice, because all the cables sit toward the back of your workspace rather than sticking out the sides.\xc2\xa0""b""But connections really shouldn't be on the section that moves a lot where they can get jiggled. When I first began using the StudioBook One, I had some minor disconnection issues while adjusting the tilt of the display and while pushing the laptop around on the desk. They stopped after a while but if you're an intensive user of external storage you don't want to run the risk of an accidental disconnection while writing to the drive.""b'Not that anything feels flimsy. This thing is built like a tank and the hinge feels extra tight.'b'The view from the side.'b""It's not a particularly thin laptop -- just under an inch (24.2mm) at its widest point -- so it's disappointing that the keyboard has so little travel. If you hate Apple's keyboards (guilty!), you'll hate this one. It feels similar to a MacBook's. More of a problem is an annoying tendency to repeat keystrokes.\xc2\xa0""b""Yes, it's expensive, but most of that cost goes toward the workstation graphics processor and the 64GB RAM. Asus only offers the one configuration. The next step down is the $4,000 StudioBook Pro 15\xc2\xa0(with a more traditional design), the\xc2\xa0Quadro RTX 5000, 48GB RAM and a Core i7-9750H (but I think the same screen) and a couple of 17-inch lower-power models.""b""The display is a smaller variation of the 17-inch panel in the Razer Blade Pro 17, a 4K 120Hz model, but they perform differently because Asus' is matte and Razer's is reflective and a touchscreen. (Touchscreen overlays change a screen's color, contrast and brightness characteristics.)\xc2\xa0""b""The system came with one of the most accurate out-of-the-box Adobe RGB profiles I've seen in a laptop screen. Because of the anti-glare treatment it's not as bright or high-contrast as most laptop displays -- peak brightness is about 325 and contrast is around 900:1 -- but that's partly what helps with accuracy for Adobe RGB. Grayscale tracking, gamut primaries, color patch tests, saturation and luminance sweeps: The peak color error I got across all of them was 2.4 De on a single patch, and averages were all less than 1 De. (We test screens using\xc2\xa0Portrait Displays' Calman Ultimate\xc2\xa0and an\xc2\xa0X-Rite i1Display Pro Plus.)\xc2\xa0""b'A keyboard for the Apple fans.'b""Screen uniformity wasn't perfect, at least by the numbers, but was still good. I couldn't spot the reported luminance discrepancies in the bottom right and I saw minimal backlight bleed, though what I did see was in the same location).""b""The charts were so pretty that I just kept throwing more and more tests at it. (Don't judge me.) So there are some caveats about this terrific display. It's not color accurate for sRGB because there's no profile for it and no way to create one within the tools provided. On the upside, it does have consistently accurate gray scale tracking across sRGB and P3.\xc2\xa0""b'Asus wins the prize for most beveled edges on a laptop.'b'\xc2\xa0Your only hardware choices are Normal (Adobe RGB), Vivid, Eye Care (low blue-light emission) and Manual, which only lets you change the color temperature, and only on an imprecise integer scale of -50 to +50 rather Kelvin presets.'b""All you can do with the basic calibration utility included is recalibrate the existing Adobe RGB profile. And when you do that, it disconnects your external displays without warning and fails to reconnect them when it's done. Nor does that profile have a luminance value attached to it, which is a problem since it's characterized at maximum brightness and accuracy decreases as you lower the system brightness.\xc2\xa0""b""It only covers 88% of the D65 P3 color space, while most decent screens tend to be at least 92%, which means it's not optimal for cross-platform color workflows with Apple screens.""b""Clearly you can calibrate it for the other color spaces with software like Calman, X-Rite's i1Profiler, DisplayCal and so on. But for the price and target buyer of this system, I expect something at least on par with Dell's PremiereColor or HP's DreamColor for handling multiple profiles and manual controls.""b'The StudioBook One has GPU only, autoselect and Optimus graphics modes. You can switch between them in the Nvidia control panel without having to reboot. During testing, though, if I had any external displays connected, it would put them on the Quadro and the laptop screen reverted to Optimus (in other words, the integrated graphics).\xc2\xa0'b""That has two important implications: It means you can't run the laptop screen at 120Hz if you have another monitor connected because the graphics in the ninth-gen i9-9980HK processor doesn't support it. You also take a performance hit if you want to run anything intensive on the laptop screen because it's speedier on the GPU. The extent of that hit depends on what you're doing.""b""Graphics performance can take a hit, though, because it's got speed to spare. The RTX 6000 is significantly faster than its consumer sibling, the RTX 2080 Super Max-Q, as well as the RTX 5000, for both gaming and professional graphics apps. It was a champ for real-time preview in Premiere Pro, and was only surpassed by desktop systems and the occasional fat 17-incher using a full power RTX 2080 Super (like the Gigabyte Aorus 17X ($3,982 at Amazon)) on 3D manipulation as measured by Unigine's Superposition and SpecViewPerf 13 benchmarks. Performance also degraded less than the others on the 3D apps when increasing from 1,920x1,080 pixels to 4K resolution, likely due at least in part to its 24GB of video memory.""b""I wish it used a 10th-gen Intel CPU, though. The Core i9-10980HK outperforms the ninth-gen model it replaced. And it surprisingly has Wi-Fi 5 rather than Wi-Fi 6. Once again, things that wouldn't matter so much if it were half the price.""b""I loved photo editing on this system, even as I complained to everyone on Slack about how much I hated the keyboard. I love the display even while bemoaning the clumsy GPU handling and lack of color-matching tools. I'm just going to plant my flag of ambivalence right above the display where the hot air is blowing out.""",8.0,b'Lori Grunin',"Aug. 11, 2020 6:00 a.m. PT"

Sure, you could get discrete graphics, but the laptop would still be underpowered to the point where you couldn't really enjoy playing the latest games. Acer's Nitro 5 is proof those days are in the rear-view.\xc2\xa0""b""Although you can certainly do better by spending more money, the Nitro 5 can be had at wallet-friendly prices, currently as low as $600, with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 or 1050Ti graphics that are strong enough to play current games at medium to high detail settings at the laptop display's full 1,920x1,080-pixel resolution. That's a lot of performance for not much money (as gaming laptops go, anyway) and while there are a few cut corners, you still come out ahead overall.\xc2\xa0""b'The 15.6-inch laptop debuted a little more than a year ago, but Acer continues to keep it fresh with new processors from Intel and AMD. You can still find configurations with Intel\'s seventh-generation processors inside, but you can also find it with an eighth-gen Intel Core i5-8300H or AMD FX-9830P processors starting at $750 in the US or \xc2\xa3900 in the UK. It\'s available in Australia with the new Intel hexacore Core i7-8750H processor starting at $2,000 (though that CPU pushes it out of ""bargain"" territory).\xc2\xa0'b""The Nitro 5's looks are a bit understated for a gaming laptop -- there are no big emblems or multicolor LEDs -- but its stylized cooling vents and red glowing keyboard are just enough that it won't be confused for a stodgy business laptop. The keyboard is spacious with a satisfying feel and, along with the single-brightness red backlight, the WASD keys are boldly outlined in red. There's a small number pad, too.""b""The touchpad gets the job done: It's smooth, responsive and supports all of the multitouch Windows 10 gestures. However, it's a clickpad, so there are no discrete left and right mouse buttons and there's a lot of body flex in and around it, which makes the whole thing feel shoddy. The same goes for the display casing and hinge design, which is just a little too easy to twist, bend and flex. It's nothing that affects performance, but if you tend to be careless with your electronics, it's something to keep in mind.\xc2\xa0""b'Plentiful ports for turning this laptop into a desktop replacement.\xc2\xa0'b""At 1.1-inch thick (28 mm) and about 6 pounds (2.7 kg), the Nitro 5 is not exactly travel-friendly, but at least you have the option. If you're considering this as a desktop replacement, you should be pretty happy about its port assortment.""b""There is no built-in optical drive, but with the connection options here, you can easily hook up an external one along with a keyboard, mouse and external display. The Acer's full HD IPS-type panel offers good off-angle viewing, though its colors look somewhat muted. Given the system's price, it's forgivable, but keep in mind, it's the same display whether you're paying for $600 or $800 or more depending on the components inside. \xc2\xa0""",7.9,b'Joshua Goldman',"June 22, 2018 4:00 a.m. PT"
b'HP Envy 17 (2020)',b'Laptops',CNET,"b""HP Envy 17 review: A home laptop that's sleek and satisfying, but not a standout""","b'It\'s not particularly cheap, or particularly fast, or particularly light or particularly... anything. But the HP Envy 17 is a stylish everyday workhorse laptop that I like with a large, 17-inch screen that gives it a little extra productivity oomph for remote work or school. You end up paying extra for a discrete Nvidia GeForce MX330 graphics processor that you don\'t really need, which bumps it out of ""good deal"" territory, but it\'s certainly still a good laptop for the money.'b""Now that I don't have to schlep a laptop between home and the office, I've become quite a fan of 17-inch models. If you're working or remote schooling with just a single laptop screen, then opting for 17 inches can help quite a bit. Even if you can't effectively quantify the advantages -- you can fit three more worksheet columns on the screen! -- for some reason the slightly bigger screen goes a long way to making it feel less cramped.\xc2\xa0""b""Prices for the Envy 17 range from around $1,000 to $1,800, depending upon the configuration, though it's hardly an option-fest. All models incorporate a quad-core Intel Core i7-1065G7 processor and Nvidia GeForce MX330 graphics; you can choose between the 1,920x1,080-pixel FHD or 3,840x2,160 UHD displays (an extra $290), from 8GB to 32GB of memory (an extra $50 to bump to 12GB or 16GB and $220 to jump to 32GB from 16GB) or a handful of storage configurations starting at 512GB SSD plus 32GB Optane (to accelerate it) and topping off at 1TB SSD.""b""To me, the $1,100 setup, which is the base configuration but with 16GB memory instead of 8GB, is the best value if you're going to go with the Envy; if you're so budget-constrained that you can only afford the 8GB and still want an HP, then I suggest you consider dropping down to the generic HP Laptop 17. It's not as pretty and is slower, but it can also be had for well under $1,000. You may want to think about alternatives, as well, such as a Dell Inspiron 17 3000.\xc2\xa0""b""FHD on a 17-inch screen is fine. I love 4K, but you don't really need it on a 17-inch screen -- unless you want to cram more onto it, which is the biggest reason to get the 17-inch over a 15-inch. In other words, FHD, 4K or any other resolution displays the same amount of content on all screens, it's just bigger on larger screens because it's spread out over a larger area. If you have vision issues, it can help when everything is bigger, though.""b""The Envy 17's configuration choices in the UK are different -- the closest option to our test configuration is the FHD touchscreen model for \xc2\xa31,150 -- and it looks like HP Australia doesn't believe in an Envy 17.""b""Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that you're paying a premium for the Nvidia GeForce MX330 graphics processor, but it's not so much faster than the integrated Iris Plus graphics in the Intel chip and it's a lot slower than stepping up to an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650. The one place its 2GB of graphics memory may help you is to give lightweight but immensely popular games like Fortnite a small boost. \xc2\xa0""b'The Envy 17 has a thin profile, but it still weighs a not-insubstantial 6 pounds (2.7 kg).'b""While I'd love another USB-C connection (or 12), one is pretty typical for this category of laptops. It otherwise has a fine selection of connectors, including HDMI and three USB-A, plus an SD card slot. The touchpad and keyboard feel quite nice, and there's a standalone fingerprint sensor between the right alt key and left arrow, a smart location that provides a dead zone between the two, preventing accidental keystrokes.""b""The speakers sound pretty good, as long as you tweak it in the B&O utility. The HP Optimized setting is blecch. Webcam video looks pretty typical -- noisy in low light and hotspots on my face in decent light, but nothing beyond Zoom's ability to process into passability -- and you definitely want to keep the noise cancellation on for the built-in mic array.""b'I found the 4K screen too reflective; fine on predominantly bright screens, generally with white backgrounds, but annoying for dark screens, say, watching moody movies and shows, even in dim conditions.'b""Possibly the worst placement of the power button I've seen thus far.""b""Because it doesn't try to be ultrathin or ultralight, the Envy does manage to eke better performance out of the same processor than the LG Gram 17, but that trade-off goes the other way when it comes to battery life. It did manage to last a respectable 7.5 hours on our streaming video test, though.""b""If you're thinking about going 17 inches with your next laptop, you could do a lot worse than the HP Envy 17 and might have to research a bit to do better. But you'll probably be happy enough if you stop looking right here.""",8.0,b'Lori Grunin',"Aug. 6, 2020 12:50 p.m. PT"

They're just great ultraportables for normal, everyday home office or school work and the Lenovo Yoga C740 is no different.\xc2\xa0""b""The C740, available in 14- and 15.6-inch sizes, is the update to the Yoga 730. It falls in the middle of the current Yoga two-in-one convertible lineup with the C940 above and 13.3-inch C640 below. The 15.6-inch C740 is essentially the same as the 14-inch I tested, but with a larger display and a keyboard with a number pad. My configuration lists for $870, but Lenovo regularly runs sales on it and, at the moment, it's $730. A similar configuration is available in the UK for \xc2\xa3681 and in Australia for AU$1,800.""b""At 3 pounds (1.4kg), the C740 is about a half pound heavier than its predecessor, but it also jumps from a 13.3-inch display to a 14-inch one. Oddly, though, their bodies are similar in size and the C740 is actually shorter because Lenovo eliminated much of the display's bottom bezel.\xc2\xa0""b""The display itself has good color and brightness, though you'll still have to see past reflections outside or under bright office lighting. The 720p webcam above the screen has one of Lenovo's little sliding shutters that physically blocks the camera.

You can access it even when you're not actively using the laptop. \xc2\xa0""b'The C740 has a comfortable keyboard with two levels of backlighting and a smooth and responsive precision touchpad.\xc2\xa0'b'Lenovo offers a few configurations of the C740 that include a choice of 10th-gen Core i5 or i7 processors (Comet Lake, not\xc2\xa0Ice Lake\xc2\xa0architecture), up to 16GB of memory, integrated UHD 630 graphics and up to 1TB SSD PCIe storage.\xc2\xa0'b""My configuration was perfect for typical work and entertainment use, and battery life was impressive at more than 11 hours on our streaming video test. You might want to get 16GB of memory to help with multitasking, though. The memory is soldered on, which means you can't add more post-purchase. Storage, on the other hand, can be increased on your own easily enough.\xc2\xa0""b""The C740 has two USB-C ports, but they're not Thunderbolt 3.\xc2\xa0""b""Most people looking for a general-purpose laptop will be well served with the Yoga C740, even if you never intend to use it as a tablet. The display is pen-enabled, however, so if you decide you want to use it for casual sketches or note-taking, you'll just need to pick up a pen.\xc2\xa0""b""On the other hand, if you know you want a pen, the C940, which starts at $1,250, comes with one and it has a storage and charging garage built into the laptop's body. It also has Thunderbolt 3 support for its USB-C ports, whereas the C740 does not. Sound is better on the C940 also, thanks to its soundbar hinge that delivers clear audio regardless of the screen position, and it has 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) wireless, which gives you a little futureproofing, assuming you haven't already jumped to the latest wireless standard. Lastly, you can get it configured with a six-core Core i7 processor and an UHD (3,840x2,160 pixel) HDR 400 display.\xc2\xa0""b""Those are the main differences between the two and, for me, they're things that are nice to have, but not necessities considering the price difference.

It's thin and light, has a fantastic trackpad and keyboard combo and, thanks to a processor upgrade, offers an notable power boost over 2018's Surface Laptop 2.""b""But certain drawbacks make it hard to give the Laptop 3 an unqualified recommendation over its competition. The biggest one is battery life. While far from awful, it's far below that of the MacBook Air and HP Spectre x360, as well as a step below last year's Windows Surface Laptop 2.\xc2\xa0""b""So it comes down to what you're after in a laptop.

The black aluminum version we tested is striking and, despite its susceptibility to thumb prints, never stops being satisfying to use. The Alcantara-fabric models for which the Surface Laptop line is synonymous are even more distinct.

The platinum Alcantara model looks classy, but it's disappointing that you have to splash out so much extra if you want the Laptop 3 in any other color. The black variant is, as noted, gorgeous. Paying premium for a metal finish is fair, but there's no reason for there not to be a cheaper black, gold or blue Surface Laptop 3 with 128GB storage -- as is the case with the $1,099 (\xc2\xa31,299, AU$1,699) MacBook Air model.\xc2\xa0   ""b""If you're after a higher-spec configuration, the 13-inch Surface Laptop 3 is available with a more powerful Intel Core i7 chip, 16GB RAM and either 256GB ($1,599, \xc2\xa31,549, AU$2,649), 512GB ($1,999, \xc2\xa31,949, AU$3,299) or 1TB ($2,399, \xc2\xa32,349, AU$3,949) of storage. That last option is only available in black, though. There's also a 15-inch version of the laptop, which comes with AMD processors for consumers and Intel for business. It starts at $1,199 (\xc2\xa31,119, AU$1,999) and tops out at $2,099 (\xc2\xa32,049, AU$4,399). ""b""Obviously, what model of laptop you go for depends on what your storage needs are. Personally, thanks to various streaming services and Google Drive, I store next to nothing on my computers. For someone like me, such a well-designed and respectably powered machine is a steal at $999 -- but I also have the luxury of not needing more than 8GB RAM for my job-related applications. Still, $1,299 for what's on offer is a perfectly good deal.   ""b'And hey, who ever said beauty was cheap?'b""Much of what's notable about the Laptop 3 was present in last year's Laptop 2. What's new this year? A few improvements, and one drawback.   ""b""First, the bump up to Intel's 10th-gen processor is significant. Microsoft claims the 13.5-inch Surface Laptop 3 is three times more powerful than the 2019 MacBook Air; that's not difficult given how underpowered the Air is, with its old dual-core processor compared to the quad-core in the Laptop 3. More important, our benchmarking showed dramatic improvement over last year's Laptop 2.   ""b""Anecdotally, the Laptop 3 always felt spry and zippy. I also tested the laptop's gaming performance, since Intel's new Iris graphics are claimed to be an improvement over previous integrated graphics. They generally fall into the same class as Nvidia MX150/MX250 graphics. Don't expect to play any blockbuster games on here, but I was able to play Overwatch on medium graphics settings at 1080p with only occasional dips below 30 frames per second. That means this'll be a good machine for World of Warcraft, Counter Strike and similarly well-optimized games.\xc2\xa0   ""b""You might be able to get away with Photoshop on the base-level 13.5-inch Laptop 3, and light video editing on the i7 version. But there's no dedicated graphics card on either model, so creatives looking for a machine on which to do the bulk of their video editing are best opting for something with more power.\xc2\xa0   ""b""That's to be expected, though. For a thin-and-light laptop, the power on offer here is above average. But it comes at a cost. As noted, the Surface Laptop 3 is significantly more powerful than the identically-priced MacBook Air and a good deal more so than last year's model. But battery life is the sacrifice.   ""b""In my looped video-stream test, I got far more battery life out of the MacBook Air: 13 hours and 27 minutes for the Air versus just over 8 hours for the Laptop 3. Once again, given the Air's ultralow-power Y series processor, that's unsurprising. Disappointingly, the Laptop 3's battery life was shorter than the Surface 2's and is slightly shorter than the Dell XPS 13's.\xc2\xa0   ""b""Using the laptop in my daily life, I got between 5 and 6 hours of use out of it before it needed a recharge. Which isn't bad, just OK. Keep in mind, I'm using the i5-version. The i7 may deliver different results. ""b""One last note on battery is a new fast-charge capability. Microsoft says you can go from 0 to 80% in an hour: I got 74%, which I'll call close enough.\xc2\xa0   ""b""The next big improvement is ports. One of our few issues with last year's machine was the lack of a USB-C port. Microsoft has wisely ditched the Mini DisplayPort connection and replaced it instead with USB-C port, which complements the USB-A port. It does mean you'll need a dongle to connect to an external display via HDMI over the USB-C connection if your monitor doesn't have a Thunderbolt or USB-C alt-mode connection, which still isn't very common. There's also the 3.5mm headphone jack and Microsoft's proprietary charger. However, the USB-C port does not support Thunderbolt speeds, which means it won't work with certain external GPUs.\xc2\xa0""b'And finally, the trackpad is 20% bigger. It feels super-smooth and has just the right amount of grip, and the extra, ahem, surface area is welcome. The keyboard is also excellent, with just the right amount of distance between keys and and a satisfying 1.3mm travel.\xc2\xa0   'b""I have a confession: I'm one of those freaks who actually loves the shallow keyboards on Apple's new MacBook Air and Pro laptops -- but I prefer the Surface Laptop 3's keys even over those.   ""b'With some more juice, the Surface Laptop 3 would be hard to beat in this ultracompetitive category. As it is, though, the strong trackpad/keyboard combo, improved performance and snazzy (though little changed) design make the Laptop 3 worth the price tag.\xc2\xa0   '",8.0,b'Daniel Van Boom',"Nov. 22, 2019 4:00 a.m. PT"

It's why manufacturers continue to create laptops that focus on keeping your productivity up while cutting down on size and weight. The seventh-gen Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon is a perfect example: a 14-inch business laptop that is thinner and lighter than last year's model while also increasing battery life and without sacrificing performance.    ""b'At 2.4 pounds (1.1 kg), you\'d never use the word ""lug"" when commuting or traveling with the X1 Carbon. It\'s only 14.9mm thick (0.6 in.), too, so you can slip it in and out of your bag flying in a middle seat in coach without elbowing your neighbors. And despite having a larger display than many ultraportables, it\'s still tray-table size. You can even get the X1 Carbon with one of Lenovo\'s PrivacyGuard displays to help block out what\'s on your screen when viewed from the sides. 'b""Prices currently start at just less than $1,300 and quickly ratchet up from there -- this is Lenovo's flagship business ultraportable, after all. My review laptop sells for $2,499, but it's nearly maxed out on components including an ultra-HD-resolution display with HDR400 support and has a new carbon-fiber design on its lid. Basically, it has all the appeal (and price!) of a premium ultraportable for consumers as well as Lenovo's latest privacy and security features for business, easily making it one of the best in its class. ""b'The seventh-gen X1 Carbon is seriously slim.'b""The X1 Carbon is a traditional clamshell and doesn't have the dual 360-degree hinges and the active pen of its X1 Yoga linemate. The screen does open 180 degrees, which gives you plenty of positioning flexibility and makes it easier to share your display with others at the table.""b""Lenovo offers five display options on this model, three of which are 1,920x1,080-pixel resolution. There are also a WQHD (2,560x1,440 pixel) and the UHD display (3,820x2,160 pixel) I tested, although the latter doesn't seem to be an option when buying direct from Lenovo. The UHD display is nice to have, especially for entertainment, but you'll likely need to calibrate when you get it. Mine was a little pink out of the box. ""b'The X1 Carbon has a great keyboard for as thin as it is. 'b""Regardless of your choice, the webcam squeezed into the frame above it is  fitted with a physical shutter that slides to block the camera. The laptops mics can also be cut for greater privacy. Lenovo  also offers two newer privacy features on this model: PrivacyGuard  and PrivacyAlert. The former makes it difficult for people to the sides  of your display to see what you're looking at it from head on. The  latter will actually pop up a notification on your screen if someone is  shoulder surfing while you're working. PrivacyGuard is unfortunately  only available on one of the four display options and PrivacyAlert  requires an optional IR camera in the laptop.

There are three configurations, starting at $1,399 (\xc2\xa31,300, AU$2,449), all of which use a quad-core Intel i7-8565U processor. The base model 8GB RAM, a 256GB SATA M.2 SSD, a 1,920x1,080-pixel full HD display and integrated graphics. Another $200 doubles your RAM, swaps the SATA SSD for a PCIe M.2 and adds a 4GB version of Nividia's entry-level GeForce MX150 graphics card. (It's also the only one that comes in a limited-edition quartz pink.)\xc2\xa0""b""If you're willing to go up to $1,899 for the config reviewed here (\xc2\xa31,800 in the UK and currently not available in Australia), storage gets bumped up to a 512GB PCIe M.2 SSD and the display changes to a beautiful UHD-resolution touchscreen (though you do get less battery life, unfortunately). That is definitely expensive, especially if you're simply after the most graphics power you can get for your money.\xc2\xa0""b""However, it's still not as high as a similarly configured\xc2\xa02018 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro, which is hundreds more and doesn't even have the option for discrete graphics. In other words, the price isn't as ridiculous as it sounds (or at least not as ridiculous as Apple's pricing) and the performance doesn't disappoint. As far as Windows alternatives for the MacBook Pro go, none quite hit the mark like this Stealth update. \xc2\xa0""b'There are two USB-A and two USB-C ports, one of which is Thunderbolt 3.\xc2\xa0'b""Maybe it's the metal body combined with its compact size and 3-pound weight (1.38kg), but the Stealth feels sturdy. The lid is stiff and there's no discernible flex to the base, adding to the high-quality feel. Though I know there are plenty of people out there who simply don't care about what their laptop looks like, I do, and really appreciate the clean simplicity of the Stealth.\xc2\xa0""b""The displays, regardless of which resolution you choose, are factory calibrated to 100 percent sRGB, so out of the box it's ready for content creation. It's one of the best displays I've seen on a PC this size. Above the display is an unremarkable HD 720p infrared camera.

A similarly configured version to the one reviewed here is available with new processor choices. ""b""Lenovo's Yoga two-in-one laptop line is so varied in sizes and configurations that it can be very difficult to nail down the differences between them. To further confuse things, the Yoga 520 is called the Flex 5 in the US and it comes in two sizes, one of which -- the 15.6-inch model reviewed here -- is only available in the US.\xc2\xa0""b""The 15.6-inch Flex 5 starts around $600 and goes up to $1,110 (that's about \xc2\xa3780 or AU$1,430). The configuration I reviewed is a sweet spot in the line, delivering a good balance of performance, features and battery life. Lenovo makes a 14-inch Flex 5, too, that's alternatively named the Yoga 520 for the UK and Australia, but none of them can be configured quite the same as the 15.6-inch Flex 5.\xc2\xa0""b""The larger 15.6-inch screen size makes it a good choice for those who want to have one computer for work and entertainment, while still being portable enough for throwing in a backpack or briefcase. Plus, the bigger two-in-one design is great for watching movies or giving presentations, and this system's discrete graphics even allow some low-level gaming. That said, if you are going to do a lot of traveling or need something for a daily transit commute, you may want to go with something smaller and lighter like the 13.3-inch Yoga 720. (The 720 also comes in a 15.6-inch size, but more on that later.)""b""The 15.6-inch Flex 5's 4.4-pound weight (2 kg) and larger size make it a bit unwieldy to use handheld as a tablet. Set it down on your lap or a table and the extra screen space is really nice to have, particularly for configurations with the pen-enabled full HD display. (It's also available with a 4K UHD-resolution display, but it doesn't support an active pen and the higher resolution typically shortens battery life.)\xc2\xa0""b""While the screen's brightness and color quality are very good, it doesn't get quite bright enough to combat the glare off the glass panel.

Wrapped in metal with gem-cut edges (as opposed to the all-leather Spectre Folio), the 13.3-inch convertible weighs less than 3 pounds (1.3 kg) and is only 14.5 mm thick, so it barely registers that it's in your bag.\xc2\xa0""b'Aside from looking good, the design also improves usability and performance is on par with its competition like the Lenovo Yoga C930, Samsung Notebook 9 Pro and LG Gram 14 2-in-1.

That price does include a padded leather sleeve and an active pen for drawing and writing on the screen. In the UK prices for the 13-inch x360 start at \xc2\xa31,200, while in Australia it starts at AU$2,500. But if you need long battery life and want it in a small, lightweight two-in-one design and can appreciate a stylish and functional design, the HP Spectre x360 hits all of those (and you don't need to wear a suit to use it).\xc2\xa0""b""Though the angular gem-cut edges help it stand out from other premium ultraportables, the design isn't entirely just for looks. The cutaway corners on the back edge are where you'll find the power button and one of its two Thunderbolt 3 ports. The way they're angled allows you to charge the x360 with its compact braided USB-C cable power adapter while keeping the cord out of the way. And the power button's position on the left corner makes it easy to find without looking and easy to avoid accidentally pressing in tablet mode. The button is also accessible regardless of how the display is positioned.""b""The Thunderbolt 3 port's angle keeps cords out of the way.\xc2\xa0""b""On the right side, along with a microSD card slot, headphone/mic combo jack and a second Thunderbolt 3 port, you'll find a kill switch for the webcam so you don't need a Post-it note to keep your camera private. It does not, however, cut your mics. You'll have to do that separately in Windows 10's microphone privacy settings. For additional privacy and security, there's a fingerprint reader and an IR webcam for facial recognition sign-ins with Windows Hello (although it seemed to be disabled on my x360).\xc2\xa0""b""As for the display, HP offers three options starting with what I tested, a low-power, 1,920x1,080-resolution panel. There's also a 1,920x1,080 display with HP's Sure View technology that, at the press of a button, whites out the screen obscuring what's on it for anyone not sitting directly in front of it. But, if you simply must have the most pixels for your 13.3-inch display, HP will sell you a 4K UHD touchscreen (3,840x2,160).\xc2\xa0""b""The low-power full-HD display delivers good color and contrast, though it's not particularly bright. Working outside will likely have you frequently trying to increase the brightness in vain, but it's great for battery life judging by our test results. If you work in a crowded office or your desk is regularly an airplane seat tray, I recommend getting the Sure View display.

An external display might make the most sense assuming you've got the room for one. But, if you need something more mobile and lap-friendly, the LG Gram 17 might do the trick because, despite its tall 17-inch display, it's incredibly light with a long battery life making it a standout in the category.\xc2\xa0""b""Built from a magnesium alloy, the 2020 LG Gram 17 weighs just under 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms) -- less than many smaller ultraportables and certainly less than other 17-inch models. Because the laptop feels like it's filled with nothing but air and doesn't have the weight or stiffness of aluminum, the Gram laptops (they're available in 13- and 15-inch sizes as well as an excellent 14-inch two-in-one) usually get knocked for feeling cheap or plasticky. The main issue here is that it's decidedly not cheap (and, again, it's made from metal). Prices start at $1,500 for a Costco-exclusive configuration and jump to $1,850 for the one I tested.\xc2\xa0""b""The keyboard's new number pad is great, but the centered touchpad might lead to accidental cursor movement.\xc2\xa0""b""The Gram 17's uniqueness certainly works in its favor. There are simply no other 17-inch laptops that are this light and also have a long battery life. It lasted 13 hours on our streaming video test, beating last year's model by 47 minutes on the same test. Processor performance is stepped up some, too, thanks to the addition of a 10th-gen Intel Core i7-1065G7 CPU. This is partnered with more powerful Iris Plus integrated graphics as well, giving you a little extra speed for photo and video editing and casual gaming.\xc2\xa0""b""The 16:10 2,560x1,600-resolution display gives you a bit more vertical space than more typical 16:9-ratio displays.

If you work next to a window or out in the sun you'll be fighting reflections off its glossy coating.  ""b""LG touched up the body some from the 2019 version, the hinge in particular, which makes the laptop look more polished and more worthy of its premium price. The company runs it through seven military-grade durability tests including ones for shock and vibration, so it's built for a commute or travel.\xc2\xa0""b""Part of the update is a new backlit keyboard with a full-size number pad and slightly wider Backspace, Enter and Shift keys. Overall it's a more comfortable typing experience, but the touchpad is still centered on the entire keyboard instead of directly below the space bar. This can lead to accidental brushes or clicks if you tend to drag your right palm while typing. The precision touchpad is otherwise nice to use.\xc2\xa0""b'The Gram 17 can charge via its included pin adapter or its Thunderbolt 3 port.\xc2\xa0'b'Although its weight makes it nice for travel, LG includes a full port assortment that makes it easy to connect to an external monitor or two, a keyboard and mouse, external storage and more. While many laptops in its class have moved to USB-C ports for charging, the Gram 17 comes with a power adapter that uses an old pin-type connector. However, you can still charge this laptop through its USB-C Thunderbolt 3 port. LG even includes a USB-C-to-Ethernet adapter if you want to use a wired connection instead of its Wi-Fi 6 wireless.\xc2\xa0'b""The differences between the 2020 LG Gram 17 and the 2019 version are subtle but important enough to notice. Battery life and performance are generally better. The keyboard is improved as is the overall fit and finish, making it look more premium. Unfortunately, it hasn't gotten any less expensive.
