And at $799, it's not the cheapest monitor, either. Yet thanks to its price-to-price and features-to-performance ratio, it's the best overall monitor currently available. ""b' It achieves this by offering a beautiful extreme definition screen resolution of 2,560x1,440 pixels, deep ergonomic support, useful screen options, and an impressive array of connections.'b""If you can spare $800, it's the monitor to get.""b"" Editors' note: The U2713HM is essentially a larger version of the U2412, with a few changes here and there.

'b'  Unlike the U2711 from 2010, the U2713HM houses an LED backlight and uses an AH-IPS panel as opposed to the H-IPS panel the U2711 utilized.  AH-IPS panels are a fairly new panel standard that purportedly provides high color accuracy while delivering lower power consumption. Check out the performance section to see how true that is in this case.'b"" The U2713UM's LED backlight affords it a much thinner design than previous entries in the series. Initially, the panel measures 0.9 inch thick. It then tapers back toward the rear where another 1.2 inches house the connection options and ventilation system. This brings its collective depth to 2.1 inches; that's 1.3 inches thinner than the U2711. At 13 pounds, again, we're seeing something uncharacteristic: a light 27-inch IPS monitor. Unexpected, since they can easily top 20 pounds.  ""b' 'b' The left and right side bezels measure 0.8 inch each, and the full panel width is 25.2 inches.

Not a necessarily earth-shattering discovery, given its light weight.  'b""   The U2713HM sports a complete collection of ergonomic options, including a 90-degree pivot, 45-degree left and right swivel, and 20-degree back tilt. Also, there's 4.5 inches of screen height adjustment, with panel-to-desktop space measuring 1.7 inches at the bottom and 6.2 inches at the top.  ""b""   Video connections options consist of DisplayPort, DVI, HDMI, and VGA; unfortunately they face downward, not out. Connections on monitors should face out, not down, as it simply makes connecting and disconnecting cables a lot easier. Many smaller monitors achieve this, as do pretty much all TVs.

""b' 'b' The onscreen display (OSD) array is aligned vertically along the lower-right bezel and consists of four small but well-spaced buttons. Navigating the OSD is simple and clean.

The color temperature preset allows for altering temperature values from 5,000 Kelvin up to 10,000K. The RGB preset allows you to access red, green, and blue values individually. One minor disappointment, however, is that you can't alter color temperature or RGB values when in a different preset. You can augment both hue and saturation, though.  ""b""   For the energy conscious among you (all both of you), in the top-right corner of the OSD sits an energy-use meter that gauges how much power the monitor is using.

b'Apple Pro Display XDR',b'Monitors',CNET,b'Apple Pro Display XDR: Grading on a curve',"b""The Pro Display XDR, Apple's 32-inch 6K display.""b'After waiting for what felt like forever for the Apple Pro Display XDR to arrive, it finally dropped out of the sky and on to my test bench -- and with it, a parade of colleagues. Some came simply to pet it, not caring if it was on or not. Some commented, ""It\'s a lot thicker than I expected,"" which just made me laugh. Only one ignored the shiny, plopped himself in my chair, and essentially said, ""Let\'s see some HDR footage.""\xc2\xa0'b""That, in a nutshell, is part of the brilliance of Apple's marketing. The buzz it's generated among nonprofessionals is vastly disproportionate to the small number of people for whom this display makes real sense: A subset of editors on Mac-only pro video workflows doing 1,000-nit, high-dynamic-range color correction. Mac-based photo pros retouching on high-resolution, broad-tonal-range images (who don't care about Adobe RGB). Illustrators working on designs with complex details. And so on.\xc2\xa0""b""For them, the display's $5,000-plus price tag is likely worth it for the 1,600-nit peak brightness, 6K resolution and hardware calibration profiles for a handful of reference standards and pseudo standards, such as Apple's own P3-D50 color space for design and print, specifically targeted for Mac-only operation. (I won't reiterate the complete specs.)""b'It starts at $5,000.'b""I've only had it for a brief time, so haven't begun my formal measurements or more rigorous hands-on testing. I'm still trying to work out some of the kinks -- and yes, there are some frustrating kinks and drawbacks.\xc2\xa0""b""Our evaluation unit is the cheaper $5,000 (\xc2\xa34,599, AU$8,499) version of the monitor -- the one without the $1,000 (\xc2\xa3900, AU$1,500) Nano-texture glass upgrade. While it's pretty reflective when you're staring at a black screen, under normal working conditions it's not bad as long as you don't have light shining directly at it. But if you do, that's probably a bad work setup no matter what. The XDR is fond of fingerprints, though.""b'Some things just jumped out the first time I fired it up.\xc2\xa0'b""Simply eyeballing, it has some of the best blacks I've seen in a desktop or laptop monitor. And that includes OLED. While OLED can effectively get down to zero black, the Pro Display XDR actually has some usable tonal range in the deep shadows.""b""You will see some haloing around highlights on super dark backgrounds; that's just a fact of life for the zone-based local dimming which makes HDR possible and which tends to be a bigger issue for desktop monitors than TVs. The question is, does the Pro Display have enough zones? The current generation of HDR monitors with similar mini LED backlights, such as the Asus PA32UCG, boast twice as many as the Pro Display XDR's 576.""b""Another pleasant surprise is skin tones. You don't realize how comparatively imprecise generally well-regarded monitors are in comparison -- like the iMac's -- until you pop open some portraits on the Pro Display.""b""It's also very quiet. That's because the back is functional as well as eye catching. It's basically a big heat sink, designed to dissipate the heat coming off the 1,600-nit-capable backlight. The fans only have to cool the circuit board, and blow the air out the grater. And the air coming out is cool. I've used 1,000-nit monitors, and they can generate a lot of heat out the front as well, even when they're not maxed out. Not this one.""b""The 6K resolution (6,016x3,384 pixels) is both a blessing and a curse. If you're editing 6K video, retouching 25-megapixel or bigger images, working on highly detailed illustration and so on, it comes in really handy. But the resolution, along with the HDR, is one of the reasons hardware compatibility is an issue.\xc2\xa0""b'Driving the higher resolution and higher bit depth needed for HDR requires more bandwidth than supplied by DisplayPort 1.4, the monitor protocol used by the current generation of Thunderbolt 3 controllers. So Apple does some voodoo starting with MacOS 10.15.2 Catalina to pump out more data through the port.\xc2\xa0'b""That's not new. Pushing the envelope on monitor resolutions and color depth has always required some alchemy while waiting for system chipsets to catch up. But there are sticking points for some. For instance, if you want to use it with an iMac Pro ($5,000 at Best Buy), you need to get the Blackmagic Design eGPU\xc2\xa0with its Intel Titan Ridge-generation controller because the Thunderbolt controller in the iMac Pro is too old.""b""This isn't for average consumers, it's for media professionals.""b""There are no hardware controls, either, and I really, really miss them. Even something as basic as a power button because sometimes you just want to turn it off. If you're hooked up to an iMac, you can't disable the Pro Display and use only the internal display, or vice versa. Why would you want to? Well, for one, to keep the light from one monitor from seeping into your peripheral vision. Instead, it seems you have to pull the plug or cable.\xc2\xa0""b""Lack of hardware controls is one of the things that makes it impossible to use with Windows except with Boot Camp, which has a software control panel for changing mode presets. Even if you manage to kludge a solution to make it work on a PC or Windows laptop, you're still out of luck. I plugged it into an Nvidia Quadro RTX 5000-equipped laptop and it was ugly.\xc2\xa0""b'I also miss having multiple input sources and connections and being able to switch between them so I can connect a single monitor to multiple systems. Stripping it down to a single Thunderbolt 3-only input seems a bit hostile towards your user base.'b""Normally I'd ding Apple heavily for the limited compatibility, but one thing I've learned over the years is that color management is one of the hardest things in tech to get right. So if it wants to tightly circumscribe the potential customer base, especially for a first-generation product, I'll cut the company some slack. Apple's been burned on monitors before, after all.""b'An extra, official stand for the XDR costs $1,000.'b""Want to kick back and view HDR content on your pretty new monitor that's\xc2\xa0not\xc2\xa0part of Apple TV Plus? Good luck. Streaming 4K HDR from a computer in general is confusing, but the Vega-class AMD graphics chips in the higher-end Macs are the most limited. (They don't support decryption of HDCP 2.2 DRM'd content from Netflix and Amazon.) At least in Windows under Boot Camp you can view YouTube 4K HDR video.\xc2\xa0""b""Even if you have all the hardware and software pieces in place to take full advantage of the display's capabilities, two really important features are still on the roadmap: User reference modes and support for custom calibrations.""b""And, finally: Is the sold-separately stand worth $1,000 (\xc2\xa3949, AU$1,699)? Nope. The fact that the stand matches the screen doesn't compensate for not being able to swivel the monitor, lower it enough to align its center with an iMac display or to lock into a perfectly horizontal position. Although, the latter might not matter too much to you unless you have an almost OCD-like compulsion to adjust anything on the wall that's askew.""b'You want something to play with that glides prettily? Get yourself a fidget spinner and put the Pro Display XDR on an arm or an ugly-but-more-practical stand.\xc2\xa0'b'This review is a work in progress and will be updated as testing continues.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0'",N/A,b'Lori Grunin',"Feb. 10, 2020 4:00 a.m. PT"
b'Acer Predator XB272',b'Monitors',CNET,"b""Acer Predator XB272 review:\xc2\xa0It's worth the money if you need the gaming speed""","b""Acer raises the bar for high frame-rate gamers, extending its 25-inch Predator XB252 up to 27 inches and bringing with it a maximum refresh of 240Hz. At $680 (approximately \xc2\xa3620, AU$1,050) It's not the cheapest G-Sync monitor around, but at the moment it's one of the few to refresh that fast. And for a TN panel, it's pretty good.(Don't confuse this with the as-yet-unavailable XB272-HDR, which has a completely different panel.) ""b""The trade-off, though, is resolution, which is also the same as the smaller panel. That means you can drive a truck between the pixels -- OK, not really, but it does mean that for doing things other than playing games it's not very sharp. For games, you can use G-Sync DSR to increase the perceived resolution. ""b""The XB272's layout is pretty typical, with onscreen display controls on the back right. The buttons are a little flat and hard to feel, but they're supplemented by a joystick that makes it much easier to navigate the menus than typical up- and down-arrow buttons. You can map two of the buttons directly to menu options, a nice perk. ""b""It has a reasonably broad set of options. Among the various presets there are three gaming-specific ones that change the brightness, refresh rate and white point settings. There's also a selection of three optional target overlays, adaptive contrast, and a decent set of display options for color and brightness. """,8.0,b'Lori Grunin',"June 26, 2017 4:50 p.m. PT"
b'Asus PA248Q',b'Monitors',CNET,b'Asus PA248Q review:\xc2\xa0Asus PA248Q',"b"" The Asus PA248Q doesn't quite match last year's PA246Q in performance, but that's to be expected. The PA246Q sported a more expensive panel capable of displaying more colors.""b""The trade-off? The PA248Q is much less expensive (at least $170 less) and, thanks to its more eco-friendly LED backlight, uses less power. Also, unless you're a graphics professional, you likely won't notice the PA248Q's color deficiency. The PA248Q has the same great connections and ergonomic features as its predecessor and even manages to fit in an unprecedented level of USB 3.0 support.""b' 'b""Design and features Editor's note: The PA248Q is so close in design to the PA246Q that much of the design and features section of that review is used here.""b'In the top-left corner of the 24-inch Asus PA248Q\'s chassis, written in white text, is the word ""ProArt."" If there was any ambiguity about the type of user Asus is targeting with this monitor, this small design touch should abolish it. However, while most ""Pro"" monitors, like 2011\'s PA246Q, house an aptly named Professional In-Plane Switching (P-IPS) panel, the PA248Q uses an Enhanced IPS (E-IPS) panel. In my experience, E-IPS panels typically perform worse than their P-IPS brethren in color reproduction, but we\'ll get to that later. The PA248Q houses an LED backlight as opposed to the PA246Q\'s Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp (CCFL) backlight. The result is a body that is considerably thinner than the PA246Q\'s, measuring a full 2.4 inches deep, compared with the older monitor\'s girthy 3.2 inches. Also, at 14 pounds, the PA248Q is 3 pounds lighter than the older model.'b""The bezel measures 0.75 inch on the left and right sides with the full width of the panel checking in at just under 22 inches. Aligned along the bezel are the rulerlike measurement notches last seen on the PA246Q. This precision motif continues at both the base and top of the display's neck, where two circular dials reside with measuring notches arranged along their perimeters. The dials act as measurement guides and make precise swiveling and pivoting of the panel possible.""b' 'b'Speaking of which, the monitor can swivel 60 degrees left and right, tilt back 20 degrees, and pivot 90 degrees, and its screen height can be adjusted by about 4 inches. The foot stand is fairly flat, and squarish in shape, measuring 11 inches wide by 9.25 inches deep. When knocked from the sides, the display wobbles a lot when at its full height, but hardly at all when adjusted to its lowest.'b""Along the monitor's left edge, aligned vertically, are four USB 3.0 downstream ports; the multimedia card reader from the PA246Q has been removed. Back connections include DVI, DisplayPort, VGA, HDMI, USB 3.0 upstream, and a headphone jack. There's also a power switch, tucked away on the right side. The connections face downward and would be difficult to access save for the always-useful pivot feature.""b'The onscreen display (OSD) array consists of six buttons: a small ""joystick"" nub, two function shortcuts, a preset shortcut, a Menu button, and a Source button. The buttons are separated from each other by a button\'s length of space and emit a satisfying snap when pressed.'b""You can navigate the OSD with the joystick, but its usefulness is limited. The stick can be used to scroll up and down menus, but you must use the menu button to back out of menus, which feels counterintuitive. Here's hoping Asus will add more functionality to the joystick in the monitor's next iteration. The OSD features Standard, sRGB, Scenery Mode, and Theater Mode presets, plus two additional customizable User Modes. Also included are brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, gamma, and advanced color settings including six-color hue and saturation adjustment controls and direct RGB color control using gain and offset. Rounding out the more useful options are sharpness, aspect ratio control, picture-in-picture (PIP) settings, and system setup options such as OSD window placement and duration onscreen.""b""By far the most unusual feature in the PA248Q's already considerable assembly of OSD options is QuickFit. Pressing in the joystick nub places an overlay on the screen of your choice of either grid patterns (of various units of measure) or paper and photo sizes. With the grid patterns you can more precisely and consistently organize content on a page when, say, designing graphics for the Web.""b""The paper and photo sizes would show exactly what papers and photos will look like once printed. This one seems less useful, as any self-respecting graphic artist would probably already be using Photoshop or some other program to do this. Still, it's a unique option that some will get more use out of than others.""b' 'b""Performance We tested the Asus PA248Q through its DVI input, connected to a Windows Vista PC, using the included DVI cable.

At the lower end of the grayscale, the monitor succeeded in showing dark gray down to a level of only 4 (black is 0); lower than the PA246Q, which only got as low as 6. This indicates that although very light gray could elude the PA248Q in movies and games, it's still capable of retaining some dark detail.

It  performed outstandingly in our labs-based DisplayMate tests, delivering quite \n\npossibly the best image we've seen for DVD playback. The 2408WPF packs all of its stellar performance inside \n\na practical and aesthetically pleasing design while delivering an embarrassment of connection riches. \n\nMoreover, it carries a fair price of $599; we'd wager any 24-inch display you find for less will come with \n\ntrade-offs in terms of features or performance or both. The UltraSharp 2408WFP is a great entertainment \n\ndisplay, whether it is games, DVDs, or--making use of its 1,920x1,200 resolution--HD movies. Rest assured, it \n\ndoes not drop the ball on the basics; we give it a strong recommendation should you seek a large productivity \n\nmonitor. \n""b'\nDesign\nThe Dell 2408WFP shares the same basic design as its predecessor, the UltraSharp 2407WFP. This includes the relatively \n\nthin bezel around the edge of the screen with the Dell logo along the bottom. \n'b'\nThe onscreen display is easy to navigate and includes the usual options of brightness, contrast, color, and \n\nso on. We also liked that the OSD stays on the screen long enough to evaluate any changes you make while \n\ncalibrating the display. There are also six included preset modes for activities such as playing games, \n\nwatching movies, and graphics work that affect color temperature, contrast, and brightness. \n'b""\nFrom the back, you're looking at a mostly silver enclosure, which runs along the foot and neck of the stand \n\nwith a large silver Dell logo at the top. The screen rotates 45 degrees to the left and right, and about 30 \n\ndegrees back. The screen also pivots 90 degrees to the left into portrait mode, but you'll have to rotate the \n\nscreen back first before you can actually pivot it as the stand is in the way normally. This is a minor \n\ngripe, but it's something we hope Dell will consider when they choose to redesign this chassis. \n""b'\nThe foot of the stand is the same Y-shaped, or ""bird-foot"" as it is sometimes called, design as found on last \n\nyear\'s model. The width of the stand is about 15.5 inches at its widest and really helps to make the display \n\nfeel very sturdy, even when placed on a narrow stand and the screen is raised to the top of its 4.5-inch \n\nrange. This display has many connection options, and Dell continues to make it easy to find them all.

b'Samsung SyncMaster P2770HD',b'Monitors',CNET,b'Samsung SyncMaster P2770HD review:\xc2\xa0Samsung SyncMaster P2770HD',"b""\nThe 27-inch Samsung SyncMaster P2770HD is a larger version of the P2370 that we reviewed last year.  It's essentially an HDTV that can double as a monitor. It has nearly all the TV connections you'd expect and even comes with a fully functioning remote control. It can be found at major online stores for about $430, which is not a bad price considering it's essentially a 27-inch HDTV. While its movie playback performance is hampered by a slight greenish tint and its clouding is very apparent on dark screens, the P2770HD has solid overall performance that stands up well to some of the best monitors we've seen, such as the XL2370 or the larger 27-inch HP 2709. \n ""b""\nDesign and features\nThe 27-inch Samsung SyncMaster P2770HD is a larger version of the P2370HD that we reviewed. The panel measures 2.5 inches in depth and  26.3 inches in full width, compared with the Dell UltraSharp U2711's much greater depth of 3.4 inches and larger 25.4-inch width. The Samsung's bezel measures 1.3 inches on the sides and 1.9 inches on the bottom where a light-gray Samsung logo resides. On the edge of the bezel is a plastic transparent overlay. As different colored light passes through the overlay, it gives the impression that the display is changing color. The screen has a slightly frosty matte finish and the neck of the display shares its design with the P2370HD and XL2370, which is still one of the most aesthetically interesting designs we've seen. The neck is made of transparent glass without the bluish crystals found on the P2370 and XL2370. However, the lack of blue crystals diminishes the aesthetic interest of this display. The bottom of the bezel sits about 3 inches from the desktop, but unfortunately, the screen height isn't adjustable and there isn't a screen rotation or pivot option for portrait mode. The capability to tilt the screen back 25 degrees is the monitor's only ergonomic feature. The oval-shaped footstand is 12.5 inches wide by 9.8 inches deep, but even with such a wide footstand, the display wobbles and slides considerably. However, the display only felt unstable with the screen tilted back to its fullest.\n ""b""\n\nThe P2770HD's connection options include one HDMI port, a VGA port, a DVI port, a component port, a composite port, and a coaxial connection for an antenna or cable. Also, there's a port for normal audio and a digital audio out. All of the ports are on the back  of the display in the lower right-hand side of the panel and face backward. This style of placement makes each connection easy to access; however, there is a headphone jack poorly placed back here, too. Above the connection options are four screw holes for mounting the display to the wall, VESA-style, though you'll have to supply your own mount.\n ""b""\n\nPressing your finger against the bottom right-hand corner of the bezel brings up the hidden onscreen display button array. The red, glowing buttons disappear after a couple moments without activity. The array consists of a Menu button, an Up and Down button, an Enter button, and a Plus and Minus button; however, the OSD is best navigated with the included remote control. We found navigating the Samsung's menu a less efficient experience than with other TV-like monitors, such as the LG Flatron M237WD. While changing the audio to SRS TruSurround took four steps on the Samsung, doing the same on the LG only took three steps. The options function very much like a typical HDTV. The Picture option includes controls for brightness, contrast, sharpness, and color temperature. Audio options for the built-in speakers include TruSurround--which simulates having a 5.1 or larger surround sound system--and a number of presets for movies, music, and so on.\n ""b""\n\nOur in-lab cable box is a bit dated and doesn't have  an HDMI port.  So we attached the monitor via a component cable to the box and watched a little HD cable programming. We found that the Samsung has a consistently high-quality picture. Again, we did not have an opportunity to test this with HDMI.\n ""b'\n\nThe Samsung SyncMaster P2770\'s 16:9 aspect ratio supports a ""Full HD"" 1,920x1,080-pixel native resolution. This continues the trend of monitor vendors moving toward 16:9 aspect ratio from 16:10 ratio because high-definition content--in particular 1080p movies--can fit onto a 1,920x1,080-pixel screen in full-screen mode without stretching the image.\n 'b""\nManufacturer's specifications:\nResolution: 1,920x1,080\nPixel-response rate: 5ms\nContrast ratio: 1,000:1\nConnectivity: HDMI, DVI-D, VGA, component, composite\nHDCP compliant? Yes\nIncluded video cables? DVI, HDMI\nBrightness: 300 cd/m2\nBacklight: CCFL\nPanel Type: TN\n""b""\nPerformance\nWe tested the Samsung SyncMaster P2770HD with its DVI connection. The display posted a composite score of 94 on CNET Labs' DisplayMate-based performance tests, coming in a few points lower than the other 27-inch monitor we tested recently, the Dell UltraSharp U2711. In our Dark Screen test, clouding, or backlight bleed through, was noticeable on the top and especially the bottom middle edge of the screen. Also, we noticed a slight greenish tint in our Color Tracking test, suggesting that there's a slight color-tracking problem. The P2770HD achieved a brightness score of 267 candelas per square meter. \n ""b'\n\nWe used the P2770\'s Entertainment preset to check out ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" on DVD and several 1080p movie files from Microsoft\'s WMV HD Showcase. We also looked at the same movies on Samsung\'s XL2370. In both ""Kill Bill"" and the 1080p movies, we found that while the XL2370 had consistent brighter colors than the P2770HD. For example, in a skiing scene, the snow along the mountain looked slightly greenish in comparison to the XL2370\'s representation, which looked closer to white. This isn\'t an egregious difference, but one that\'s noticeable when looking carefully with both displays side by side. \n 'b'\n\nAs good as movies looked in the Entertainment preset, we found that the Dynamic Contrast preset worked best for movie watching. With Dynamic Contrast on, we only noticed the screen darkening on scenes where the screen is 90 percent black or more, such as the end credits and during fades to black. In the DC preset, blacks looked darker and the colors slightly more full.\n 'b'\n\n We looked at World of Warcraft and Unreal Tournament 3 and noticed no signs of input lag or any streaking or ghosting during fast movement. Games looked bright without the color problem we saw in movies. \n '",6.9,b'Eric Franklin',"Feb. 24, 2010 5:33 a.m. PT"
b'Alienware 55 OLED Gaming Monitor (AW5520QF)',b'Monitors',CNET,"b""Alienware 55 OLED Gaming Monitor (AW5520QF) review:\xc2\xa0Epic gaming display, but epic price doesn't add up""","b""Every now and then I review a product which both beguiles and befuddles me. The Alienware 55 OLED Gaming Monitor has been bedeviling me in that way since it landed in the office less than two weeks ago. Beguiling, because at 55 inches it's huge -- for a computer monitor, at least -- with the broad gamut, vivid colors, spectacular blacks and superfast pixel response OLED\xc2\xa0is known for. It's also a looker, in the striking Legend design system the company rolled out in early 2019. But also befuddling, because I can't make sense of it as something someone would want to buy over an alternative, like the $1,600 2019 LG C9 series, given the Alienware's $4,000 price tag. For $3,000, maybe. For $2,500, probably.""b""It may be thick on the bottom, but it's ultrathin on top.""b""It's important to understand that nothing compares to OLED for gaming. The technology wins the image-quality trifecta of contrast (because black pixels are truly black), color gamut (a minimum of over 90%\xc2\xa0UHDA P3) and color accuracy (because of its relatively pure spectral intensities). Plus its pixels turn on and off as close to instantaneously as you can get, which minimizes ghosting. Unlike most movies, games also push the limits of color, as computer graphics actually use all those maximally saturated colors at the edges of the gamut that aren't found in nature.""b""From that perspective, you just want to park yourself in front of the Alienware 55 and game until you're evicted.""b""As a monitor, the Alienware does offer some advantages over a TV like the LG. In the absence of HDMI 2.1 support -- stick a pin in that topic, for the moment -- its DisplayPort 1.4 connection is probably the biggest difference. It delivers the bandwidth necessary to support 4K at its maximum 120Hz refresh rate rather than at the usual 60Hz. (Higher refresh rates give you more headroom for synchronizing the frame rate of a game with the display, which helps avoid artifacts.) Plus, 120Hz can also make simply viewing the screen easier on your eyes than 60Hz, depending upon how sensitive you are and what you're watching. ""b'It also has familiar monitor perks, including four USB-A ports, two in an easily accessible location on the side. In this case, it gives you somewhere to stick your wireless dongles and devices with long cables.\xc2\xa0 'b'On the left side is an HDMI connector, two USB-A ports and a headphone jack.'b""Beneath the screen you'll find standard monitor controls, and it comes with a snazzy remote with two halves that snap together with magnets -- and which come apart (but don't break) when you drop it. The onscreen display's options bear more similarity to a monitor's than a TV's as well.""b""If you're familiar with Dell monitors, you'll recognize the Smart HDR modes -- in this case, game, movie, desktop and reference -- which report to Windows whether it can toggle its HDR settings. If you've chosen the game setting, Windows can enable it for games or wide-color gamut. If you want it for movies, you'll have to enable that setting instead.\xc2\xa0 ""b""The Alienware 55 next to the Alienware m15 R2 laptop. The command center software didn't recognize the monitor to control the lighting, though, so I couldn't sync them. The back panel attaches via magnets, making it easy to remove when you need to access the connections.""b'Additionally, it has various game-type presets, such as for first-person shooter and real-time strategy games. Each visibly changes the white point and gamma of the display in order to, say, increase the brightness in shadow areas. FPS changes the display most dramatically, boosting the brightness so you can make out shadow detail.\xc2\xa0'b""But I frequently found myself switching among them midgame in Borderlands 3\xc2\xa0-- to FPS when I needed shadow detail, but back to anything else afterward, because FPS made it too washed out and had a greener cast in order to boost the brightness. You won't find crosshair options; OLEDs are especially susceptible to burn in, so you wouldn't want one sitting on the screen for hours on end.""b'The Alienware 55 design matches the latest gaming gear from the company, such as the Area-51m laptop. Being an Alienware, naturally it has custom lighting, which you can set via the onscreen menus or when connected via USB.\xc2\xa0'",8.0,b'Lori Grunin',"Sept. 30, 2019 3:00 a.m. PT"

b'Dell UltraSharp 2007FP',b'Monitors',CNET,b'Dell UltraSharp 2007FP review:\xc2\xa0Dell UltraSharp 2007FP',"b''b""Dell gets just about everything right with the UltraSharp 2007FP. The $539 price is competitive, and the combination of ergonomic design, chic good looks, and practical extras is sure to please home and business users alike. Many more-expensive 20-inch LCDs, such as the Samsung SyncMaster 204T and the HP LP2065 offer similar adjustability and performance, but both monitors lack the variety of inputs and the low cost of the Dell UltraSharp 2007FP. For identical features in a wide-screen format, check out our review of the Dell UltraSharp 2007WFP.\n\nThe 20.1-inch Dell 2007FP features the same two-tone color scheme and attractive, versatile design as other members of the UltraSharp family. A  thin, black bezel frames the screen, and a slim neck extends from a Y-shape base. This design offers exceptional flexibility, with 45 degrees of swivel to the right and left and five inches of height adjustment. The panel also pivots from landscape to portrait mode and tilts 5 degrees forward and 20 degrees back. The pivoting action is a bit stiff, and the short back leg of the base makes the 2007FP a tad unsteady, but the overall merits of the design far outweigh these minor shortcomings.\n\nLined up on the 2007FP's back panel are connection ports for DVD-D, VGA, composite video, and S-Video, as well as one upstream and two downstream USB 2.0 ports and a 12-volt audio jack for connecting the optional $29 Dell Sound Bar. Two more downstream USB 2.0 ports are tucked behind the monitor's left bezel. Dell includes analog and digital cords as well as a USB cord.\n\nFive control panel buttons are clearly labeled with white-on-black icons for switching input signal and navigating the onscreen menu (OSM). Dell takes an interesting approach to its OSM layout; instead of a box in the middle of the screen, the OSM is a line of squares along the monitor's bottom edge labeled Exit, Brightness & Contrast (contrast is VGA-only), Auto Adjust (VGA-only), Input Source, Color Settings, Image Modes, Display Settings, Menu Settings, and PIP Settings. When you select a square, it brightens a little and its tiny icon changes color, but even with these cues, it's difficult to tell which option you're selecting. To complicate matters, each adjustment option has its own menu and submenu of adjustment choices to scroll through. This allows for a plethora of adjustment options, but the menus are difficult to navigate; we wish there were dedicated shortcut buttons for the most-common image adjustments, such as brightness and contrast.\n\nThe Dell 2007FP performed extremely well on CNET Labs' DisplayMate-based performance tests.  At its native 1,600x1,200 resolution, the 2007FP's text was black, sharp, and entirely legible. Grayscales progressed smoothly from deep black to bright white, with only very minor pink and green tints. The 2007FP's colors were bold and accurate, though in our color tests, red took on an orange cast and light blue appeared slightly violet, and adjusting the screen's settings didn't eliminate these errors.\n\nDVD playback on the Dell 2007FP was only average, which is not surprising, considering the 2007FP's middling 16-millisecond pixel-response rate. We noticed average amounts of digital noise and ghosting, though errors weren't excessive. Games, however, looked sharp with lots of detail in both bright and dark areas and vivid colors throughout.\n\nThe Dell 2007FP comes with an industry-standard three-year warranty and 24/7 toll-free tech support. You can buy one additional year of coverage for $29 or two years for $49.  User guides, product support, troubleshooting tips, and a Dell-hosted customer information-sharing forum are all available on Dell's Web site.\n\n""",7.8,b'Jeffrey Fuchs',"March 26, 2006 7:00 p.m. PT"
b'Asus PB278Q',b'Monitors',CNET,b'Asus PB278Q review:\xc2\xa0Great performance at a good price',"b'In the world of extreme-definition monitors, the Asus PB278Q almost perfectly hits a happy medium between features and value. I reviewed the HP ZR2740w earlier in 2012, and while that monitor offered great performance at a reasonable price, aside from brightness, customization features were nowhere to be found.'b""\n\nThe PB278Q is like getting the ZR2740w with better performance, and with a great assortment of customization features at about the same price. The Asus can't quite match the performance of the $100 more expensive Dell U2713HM and lacks the Dell's USB ports and plentiful assortment of presets, but for $100 less it's a great lower-priced alternative for those looking to save a few bucks on an extreme-definition monitor.""b""Design and features\nThe 27-inch Asus PB278Q is one of the first non-Samsung monitors to house a plane-to-line switching (PLS) panel. Previous to this, the Samsung SyncMasters S27A850D and S27B970 hold the distinction as the only other two monitors to feature the company's still relatively new panel tech. Like most monitors produced today, the PA248Q houses a white LED backlight resulting in a fairly thin, 2.6-inch deep chassis. Also, at 19.4 pounds, it's surprisingly light for a 27-inch monitor.""b""The bezel measures 0.8 inch on the left and right sides with the full width of the panel checking in at just under 25.25 inches. The 11-inch-wide footstand is the monitor's most eye-catching visual trait, measuring 11 inches by 8.6 inches. When knocked from the sides, the monitor does wobble more than I'd like. This is not too surprising when the swivel mechanism, located on the bottom on the foot stand, is taken into account, as it keeps the stand from sitting completely flat. Unfortunately, due to the awkward implementation, the entire chassis swivels when rotated, not just the screen. ""b'Speaking of which, the monitor can swivel left and right, tilt back 20 degrees, and pivot 90 degrees, and its screen height can be adjusted by about 4.5 inches. 'b'Connections include DVI, DisplayPort, VGA, HDMI, a headphone jack, and an audio-in port. The connections face downward and would be difficult to access save for the always-useful pivot feature.'b""The onscreen display (OSD) array consists of six buttons located in the lower right of the bezel on the underside of the panel and includes a preset shortcut, a Menu button, and a Source button. The buttons are separated from each other by about half a button's length of space and emit a satisfying snap when pressed.""b'Navigating the OSD feels a bit clunky, as the menu button and and preset shortcut buttons act as enter and exit button, respectively; I wish Asus could have found a less confusing way to implement its OSD controls. The OSD features Standard, sRGB, Scenery Mode, and Theater Mode presets, plus one additional customizable User Mode. Also included are brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, gamma, and advanced color settings, among which are six-color hue and saturation adjustment controls and direct RGB color control using gain and offset. Rounding out the more useful options are sharpness, aspect ratio control, picture-in-picture (PIP) settings, and system setup options such as OSD window placement and duration onscreen.'b""By far the most unusual feature in the PA248Q's already considerable assembly of OSD options is QuickFit. QuickFit places an overlay on the screen of your choice of either grid patterns (of various units of measure) or paper and photo sizes. With the grid patterns you can more precisely and consistently organize content on a page when, say, designing graphics for the Web.""b""The paper and photo sizes would show exactly what papers and photos would look like once printed. This one seems less useful, as any self-respecting graphic artist would probably already be using Photoshop or some other program to do this. Still, it's a unique option that some will get more use out of than others.""b'\n'b""Performance\nI tested the Asus PB278Q through its DisplayPort input, connected to a Windows 7 PC, using the included DVI cable. The display posted a composite score of 96 on CNET Labs' DisplayMate-based performance tests.\n""b""\nDisplayMate: The PB278Q displayed light gray up to level 254; 255 is considered white, and every level between it and 1 is a variation of gray, so 254 is as high as you can get. The PB278Q's performance here indicates that the display would retain its contrast ratio and likely not be prone to washing out light colors. As for dark gray, the U2713HM just barely displayed down to level 6 while still maintaining a deep black, which points to the display not being capable of retaining dark detail during dark scenes in movies. \n""b"" \n\n\n\nThe PB278Q excelled in most of our color tests, but didn't display color as accurately or as smoothly as the U2713HM, displaying more obvious jumps in color scale progression. \n""b' \nIn our Dark Screen test, I stare at a screen devoid of color in an attempt to identify spots where light from the backlight seeps through (known as \xe2\x80\x9cclouding\xe2\x80\x9d). While some noticeable light bled through the upper right corner, the PB278Q did a pretty good job at keeping unwanted light at bay and overall, the PB278Q displayed less backlight bleedthrough than the Dell U2713HM.\n'b'\nText: Black text on white looked clear, without any obvious color tint problems. Also, fonts were clearly visible down to a 6.8-point size.\n'b'\nMovies: I tested the Asus PB278Q using the Blu-ray version of ""Avatar."" The Theater preset provided a decent picture. The colors were vibrant, but the color temperature was a bit too cool and dark detail was practically nonexistent. The Standard mode fared a bit better for dark detail, but wasn\'t as vibrant. \n'",8.0,b'Eric Franklin',"Dec. 12, 2012 4:41 p.m. PT"

If I had to come up with a single word to describe it, I\'d go with ""overdesigned."" It\'s strikingly stylized and a bit impractical. Its bright 27-inch, 2,560x1,440-pixel panel is quite good, and its feature set, which includes support for FreeSync and G-Sync-Compatible adaptive refresh, a wide color gamut and a 144Hz refresh rate, hits most of the right notes you\'d expect for its big $700 price tag.'b""That's on the high side, though, since you can get the just-as-terrific, albeit less fancy-schmancy, 4K Acer Predator XB273 for only $100 more.

While I love the gray fabric, I can't help but picture it covered with orange cat hair.""b""To access the connectors, you can tilt the display back 90 degrees. That kind of ease of access is a touch few monitor manufacturers think about, but which makes life so much better when you work on a crowded desktop or need to frequently get to them.

Razer designed it to use flat, bright green cables with right-angle connectors that feed through individual channels in the back. That means if a cable is bad you need to replace it with a matching one from Razer, or suffer with a third-party flat cable that doesn't look the same, or worse, a standard cable that doesn't bend in the right ways, all defeating the purpose of the highly stylized design.\xc2\xa0""b'It tilts 90 degrees so you can get to the connectors underneath. A really, really big convenience.'b""The cables don't glide easily through the channels, so getting everything to lie properly can be a pain. While DisplayPort, HDMI, USB-C cables and a USB-A extender come in the box, there's no matching DisplayPort to Mini DisplayPort cable... which you'd need to connect to a Razer laptop, or most any laptop, to get G-Sync compatible adaptive refresh. Although it supports USB-C alt mode (DisplayPort) for connecting via USB-C, Nvidia requires the monitor be on the GPU bus for all G-Sync variable refresh, but USB-C is on the internal GPU/CPU bus.""b'The cabling design is kind of high-maintenance. But the underglow on the base is cool.'b""Plus, that side-by-side channel design means the base has to be huge at a time when most manufacturers are going small to conserve desk space.

b'LG Flatron E2350V',b'Monitors',CNET,b'LG Flatron E2350V review:\xc2\xa0LG Flatron E2350V',"b""The LG Flatron E2350V is essentially LG's version of the Samsung SyncMaster XL2370: a thin, 23-inch monitor, with an LED backlight and a minimalist aesthetic design. The E2350V is sleek, although not quite as stylish or unique-looking as the XL2370 or its updated version, the Samsung PX2370, which both stand out thanks to their transparent necks. The E2350V has great games performance, on par with the XL2370 and PX2370; however, the PX2370 has a slight performance edge in movies, because of a seemingly deeper color gamut. Thanks to its black-level control feature, the E2350V has a lower black level than either Samsung monitor, but unfortunately, it also has a dimmer screen than the two. \n""b"" \nThe E2350V's trump card is its lower, $280 price. That's $20 less than the XL2370 and $30 less than the PX2370. The E2350V also has unique features like an ambient light sensor and a headphone jack. If you're looking for an LED monitor, go with the PX2370 because of its superior performance. If price is a concern, however, you can't go wrong with the E2350V. It has the performance, features, and the looks to make it well worth its price.\n""b""\nDesign and features\nThe 23-inch LG Flatron E2350V looks like it was modeled directly after the Samsung SyncMaster XL2370. Both monitors have similarly thin profiles, with virtually the same physical dimensions; however, with its transparent neck and edges the XL2370 has an aesthetic flare the E2350V can't match. The Flatron E2350V's panel depth measures 0.65 inch, which is slightly more than the XL2370's considerably thin 0.6-inch depth. The Flatron E2350V's bezel measures 0.9 inch, which is shorter than the XL2370's 1.1-inch. The full width of the Flatron E2350V is 22 inches, and that's about the same as most 23-inch monitors. The Flatron E2350V's screen has a matte finish and its glossy, black neck is similarly curved like the XL2370's. The oval-shaped footstand measures 9.9 inches wide and 8.4 inches deep. Although the display wobbles considerably when knocked from the sides, we don't think it's in any great danger of toppling over, given the well-designed distribution of its light, 7.38-pound weight. The bottom of the bezel sits 2.8 inches from the desktop, about the same as the XL2370. \n""b"" \nLike the XL2370, the screen height isn't adjustable and there aren't screen-rotation or pivot options for portrait mode. The capability to tilt the screen back 10 or 90 degrees is its only included ergonomic feature. The Flatron E2350V's connection options include DVI-D, HDMI, and VGA, and a headphone jack. All connections sit on the back in the lower midsection of the panel and face backward, instead of down like on most monitors, making them easy to access. \n""b' \nThe Flatron E2350V includes an onscreen display (OSD) array in the lower-right-hand side of the bezel, with the power button to the right of the array. The power button resides above a cool-looking grayish-white LED stripe, and each OSD button is denoted with a small LED dot of the same color. Touching any of the dots brings up the OSD, with each dot perfectly aligned to the onscreen option of the OSD. The array consists of six different buttons: Menu, Smart+, F Engine, Auto, Input, and Exit. With each new menu screen, the buttons alter their function, acting instead as the ""up,"" ""down,"" or ""previous menu"" buttons, making navigating the menu a simple endeavor.   \n'b"" \nPressing the Menu button allows you to navigate through Brightness, Contrast, and Sharpness controls. LG also includes a Black Level control--which includes two settings: low and bright--that affords the E2350V a lower black level than most monitors have. The OSD also includes controls for color temperature--including individual RGB controls--gamma control, a volume control for the headphone jack, and an ambient light feature called Auto Bright that adjusts the display's brightness depending on the amount of ambient light in the room. Presets include Standard, Movie, Game, and Sports. Each preset provides a preview of its settings, by dividing the screen in half: on the left is what it's currently set to, and on the right is what it could look like with the preset.\n""b'  \nThe LG Flatron E2350V\'s 16:9 aspect ratio supports a ""Full HD"" native resolution of 1,920x1,080 pixels. This continues the trend of more and more monitor vendors moving toward 16:9 from 16:10 because high-definition content--in particular 1080p movies--can fit onto a 1,920x1,080-pixel screen in full-screen mode without stretching the image.\n'b'\n\n'b""\nPerformance\nWe tested the LG Flatron E2350V with its DVI connection. The display posted a composite score of 94 on CNET Labs' DisplayMate-based performance tests, just below the XL2370's 96, and the PX2370's 97. Thanks to its black-level control feature, the LG Flatron E2350V demonstrated a low black level in our grayscale tests; lower even than the PX2370. However, the E2350V and the PX2370 allowed virtually the same amount of light through their respective screens in our dark-screen test. The PX2370 seemed to have a larger color gamut as evidenced by our color scales test, where the LG Flatron E2350V didn't distinguish between similar colors as well as the PX2370 did. Overall, the two monitors performed similarly in DisplayMate, with the PX2370 getting a slight edge, especially in color tests. \n ""b"" \nThe LG Flatron E2350V achieved a brightness score of 197 candelas per square meter (cd/M2), much lower than the XL2370's 344 cd/M2 and still lower than the PX2370's 246 cd/M2. However, thanks to its low black level, the Flatron E2350V had a much higher tested contrast ratio of 1,355:1, compared with the 1,008:1 and 948:1 of the XL2370 and PX2370, respectively. \n ""b' \nWe used the LG Flatron E2350V\'s movie preset to check out ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" on DVD and a number of 1080p movie files from Microsoft\'s WMV HD Showcase. In both ""Kill Bill"" and the 1080p movies, we found that the PX2370\'s more accurate and vibrant color surpassed the LG Flatron E2350V\'s color quality. In a side-by-side comparison, red on the LG Flatron E2350V looked closer to orange when compared with the deeper red we saw on the PX2370 in the same scene.\n '",7.7,b'Eric Franklin',"May 12, 2010 10:35 p.m. PT"
b'Samsung CF791',b'Monitors',CNET,"b""Samsung CF791 review:\xc2\xa0Samsung's big-screen gaming champ for AMD Radeon fans""","b""I have enough ambivalence about curved monitors to fill a 34-inch screen. For games? No question it's good. For movies and work, though, it gives pause. Most movies use a 16:9 or 16:10 aspect ratio so at best they float in the middle of a 21:9 screen. And, for example, you can comfortably fit three windows side by side, but if you only need two neither one is directly in front of you -- you're staring at the space between them. ""b'Keeping those caveats in mind, the 34-inch Samsung CF791 (the C34F791WQN, to be precise) is an excellent option in this class. 'b""It's great for gaming, with sufficiently fast response times, a solid AMD FreeSync implementation (with a 100Hz max refresh, you've also got some leeway on lower-power Nvidia GPUs), vivid colors and a reasonable amount of configuration flexibility. Field of view, people. ""b""It's not cheap, but I don't think its $950 price tag is unreasonably high for what it offers. In the UK it costs \xc2\xa3800. I don't see it offered in Australia, at least not yet (for reference, the US price directly converts to AU$1,050). Samsung also offers a less-expensive display -- Samsung prices it higher but it has a lower street price -- the SE790 (technically, the LS34E790CNS). However it doesn't support FreeSync or use the company's Quantum Dot technology, and it's less curved. ""b""Setting it up is dead easy, mostly because the stand is integrated. It rises or lowers as it slides along a track that simultaneously tilts it. In other words, at its highest, you're viewing it directly ahead. At its lowest, it tilts back so you're looking down at it. You can adjust the amount of tilt, giving it a cockpit feel that's a comfortable way to give your neck and upper back a change. It's probably a really good fit for standing desks. ""b""You can configure the HDMI and full-size DisplayPort inputs to display simultaneously in Picture-in-Picture or Picture-by-Picture modes, and there's an HDMI out for passing the signal through to another monitor or TV.\xc2\xa0 ""b""Since they're positioned on the left side and not blocked by the arm, the connectors are really easy to reach. And while I'm not crazy about the white and silver, it's much easier to read the connection labels than with many of the dark cabinets. ""b'I also like Samsung\'s single-control joystick design for navigating the onscreen display and options. But it means there\'s no way to map custom presets or FreeSync modes for direct access. The Samsung Magic Bright ($41 at Best Buy) setting actually refers to its preset modes rather than brightness, and its ""Basic"" mode is sRGB. In fact, there\'s a lot of ambiguity in the OSD: Gamma choices are Mode1, Mode2 and Mode3, for example. But there\'s a respectable set of options, including dynamic contrast, HDMI black level (which I believe is necessary to compensate on Quantum Dot panels). Magic Upscale basically oversharpens everything.'",8.3,b'Lori Grunin',"July 9, 2017 5:43 p.m. PT"
b'Apple LED Cinema Display (27-inch',b'Monitors',CNET,b'Apple LED Cinema Display (27-inch review:\xc2\xa0Apple LED Cinema Display (27-inch',"b""Let's get right to it. If you're considering purchasing the 27-inch Apple LED Cinema Display, know that you'll need a Mac with a Mini DisplayPort connection in order to use it. If you only own a PC or older Mac, you're out of luck. \n""b"" \nNot that the display's aesthetic appeal and fantastic performance won't inspire some to make the plunge right into a new Mac. Movies and games look great on the display, but what impressed us more was the way it handled fonts. Thanks to its glossy screen coating, fonts have a smoothness we've rarely seen, which makes doing everyday tasks almost as appealing as watching a movie. Almost. Also, the display works nearly seamlessly with our compatible MacBook Pro, including a MagSafe connector that charges the laptop as long as the monitor is plugged in. \n""b"" \nUnfortunately, the same glossy coating that provides smooth fonts is also highly reflective. And don't plan on adjusting the display beyond tilting it back 10 degrees, as no other ergonomic option exists. \n""b"" \nSo $1,000 is a tough pill to swallow for a display with such a focused intended use, especially with the availability of other monitors like the Dell UltraSharp U2711, which has slightly better performance and is only $100 more. Unless you find some kind of adapter, though, you likely won't be connecting it to your MacBook. \n""b"" \nPC users will obviously want to steer clear of the 27-inch LED Cinema Display; Mac desktop users would be better served with the Dell and its numerous customization and ergonomic options. MacBook Pro users willing to pay the price won't be disappointed with the LED Cinema Display's performance and synergy with their laptop of choice. \n\n\n\n\n""b'\nDesign and features\nDesign-wise, the 27-inch Apple LED Cinema Display is, for all intents and purposes, a larger version of the 24-inch LED Cinema Display the company released in 2008, with a few changes. Those changes include an obviously larger screen, a much higher 2,560x1,440-pixel resolution, and an ambient light sensor. The ambient light sensor automatically adjusts the screen brightness depending on the amount of (you guessed it) ambient light in the room. Other extras found on the 24-inch model are retained here, including a built-in camera and microphone, built-in 2.1 speakers, and three USB ports located on the lower back left. \n'b"" \nThe monitor's chassis, including the back of the monitor and its foot stand, is the same smooth metallic gray seen on the 24-inch LED Cinema Display and Apple's Macbook Pros. The panel is 2.25 inches in full depth and about 25.6 inches wide, making it as wide as the 27-inch Dell UltraSharp U2711, although about 1.2 inches shallower. The bezel, flush with the screen, is 1.1 inches wide on the right and left sides, and the distance from the bottom of the bezel to the desktop is 3.6 inches. The foot stand is 7.4 inches wide, 8.2 inches deep, and the monitor hardly moved when we knocked it from the sides. This is in part thanks to the flatness and width of the foot stand, but also the display's heavy 24-pound weight. \n""b"" \nIf you own a MacBook from late 2008 or later, you'll be able to connect the 27-inch LED Cinema Display to your computer via Mini DisplayPort, otherwise, um, no. Like the previous 24-inch monitor, Apple refuses to offer DVI support for PCs and owners of older Macs. \n""b' \nThe display includes a 10-degree back tilt as its sole ergonomic option, with no screen-height adjustment, pivoting, or swivel offered. \n'b' \nCalibration options in OS X include brightness, color temperature, gamma, and contrast controls. The interface for the latter can only be accessed by turning on expert mode from the Display Calibrator Assistant. \n\n'b'\n\n'b'\n\n'b""\nPerformance\nDisplayMate Performance: We tested the 27-inch Apple LED Cinema Display through its Mini DisplayPort input, connected to a MacBook Pro running both Snow Leopard and Windows 7. The display posted a composite score of 97 on CNET Labs' DisplayMate-based performance tests--only 1 point lower than the Dell UltraSharp U2711.The display excelled at nearly every DisplayMate test we threw at it, achieving performance as good or sometimes better than the U2711. The only glaring performance problem we noticed was in our High Contrast Streaking and Ghosting test. This tests a display's ability to accurately display an image when large changes in contrast are present, such as a bar graph. We saw very apparent ghosting in the bottom level of this test screen; however, it should be noted that we didn't see evidence of this during real-world usage. \n""b'\nText: In text, we saw no color problems with black text on a white background. Fonts were visible down to a 6.8-point size, and thanks to the screen coating on the monitor, the fonts have a smoothness unmatched by the Dell UltraSharp U2711. \n'b'\nMovies: We tested the 27-inch Apple LED Cinema Display using the Blu-ray version of ""Avatar.""  Movies had an impressively low black level and no noticeable color tint problems. Colors were accurate without looking drab. \n'b'\nGames: Because of our intimate familiarity with World of Warcraft (WoW), it remains the best tool for judging color quality and vibrancy in games. WoW had a vibrancy and level of color saturation seen only on a few monitors before, for example the Dell UltraSharp U2711 and Samsung PX2370. \n'",7.6,b'Eric Franklin',"Sept. 28, 2010 4:58 a.m. PT"
b'Sony PlayStation VR',b'Monitors',CNET,b'Sony PlayStation VR review:\xc2\xa0You know what? Sony did it. The PSVR is actually pretty great',"b'It looks like 2016 is living up to its billing as the ""year of virtual reality,"" with products at the high end (HTC Vive and Oculus Rift) and in the mobile arena (Samsung Gear VR, Google Cardboard, Google Daydream) offering VR options across the spectrum. 'b'Now a new contender appears, with an established brand and a gigantic install base. The PlayStation VR, available October 13, represents the most accessible path to VR if only because every one of the roughly 45 million PlayStation 4 owners already has half the required hardware.'b'It\'s also the only ""full"" VR system -- that is, one with spatial and motion tracking -- that\'ll get you up and running from scratch for under $700, \xe2\x80\x8e\xc2\xa3630 or AU$1,050. By itself, if you already have a PS4, it\'s $399, \xc2\xa3349 or AU$550. The combined cost (PC plus headset) for Oculus and Vive currently sits north of $1,200.'b""To be sure, this is an expensive toy and certainly not for everyone. In fact, Sony says it's not designed for kids 12 years and under. But considering its price and the fact that you may already have half the hardware sitting in your living room, the PSVR presents a very compelling proposition. ""b""Combine that with PlayStation's well-established distribution platform, close relationship to the developers crafting these VR experiences and quality control, and the PSVR is a more worry-free answer to the potentially confusing world of PC-based VR.""b'Updated November 21, 2016 to include impressions of PSVR with the PlayStation 4 Pro.'b''b''b""Setting up either of the two existing PC-connected VR rigs isn't pretty. The same goes with the PSVR. It's not an overly complicated process, but the interconnected wired web that results isn't necessarily something you can tuck away out of sight.""b""You'll need an extra outlet to power the PSVR's processor unit and you'll also need to devote one of the PS4's two USB slots so that it can talk to the console. The unit is about the size of three CD jewel cases stacked on top of each other -- this of course needs a place to live as well.""b""The whole thing took me about 10 minutes to connect my first time. When it's all done and dusted, what you're left with feels inelegant and messy, but part of VR is being tethered to a long wire. That's just where the tech is right now. Compared to the Rift and Vive, the PSVR is no better or worse in that department.""b""Buying the standard $399 PSVR kit assumes you already own a PlayStation Camera and two Move controllers. You absolutely need the camera to use the PSVR and two Move controllers are all but required. If you don't possess these items you'll need to purchase them separately. But don't do that. For $499, Sony sells a bundle that includes everything you need -- save for a PS4 -- and packs-in the mini-game collection VR Worlds as a bonus. It's a good deal if you're missing some of the prerequisites.""b""Update, August 2017: Sony now includes the PlayStation Camera in the box, and the launch bundle can be had for $450. Effectively, it's a $50 price cut across the board.""b""With everything connected and the headset on, I was surprised that booting up the PS4 didn't force me to start any kind of in-depth setup. A few quick adjustments and I was mostly ready to go. When you press the headset's inline power button, the console switches into VR mode which shifts the menu screen to the headset and mirrors a lower res version of what you're seeing onto the TV.""b""Intuitive icons explain that you can recenter the home screen if you need to at any time (which is probably something I do at least twice a session). Instead of a general initial setup, most software will activate a number of calibration check marks so that you get the best optimal performance for that specific experience. Long story short, at the very least you'll probably be doing some kind of minimal adjustment to your VR play area each time you play. The more I played, the more I learned which games needed more finessing than others. ""b'In the manual, Sony says you need approximately a 10 by 6 foot area (about 3 by 2 meters) needed for play, but I was able to get it working fine in a space only about 7 by 4 foot (about 2 by 1.5 meters). The PSVR seems relaxed about how much space you need, and even a few square feet of floor space could end up working for a handful of games.'b""Included with our review kit was a PowerA $50 stand -- think mannequin head -- to hold and organize all of the PSVR accessories. It's actually something worth checking out because there's not a really good place to store all of these items when you're not using them. The stand also charges two Move controllers and a DualShock4 PlayStation controller simultaneously. It has a spot to hang the headset too, but it tends to droop down too much.""b'The PowerA charging stand ($50).'b""Lastly, if you're at all concerned about HDR compatibility, the PSVR's processing unit will not pass an HDR signal through. You'll need to use a direct HDMI connection for HDR to work whether you're using a PS4 or PS4 Pro.""b'The question I get asked most about PSVR is, ""Does it work?"" Make no mistake: I let out an audible gasp the first time I tried Batman Arkham VR. It felt similar to the first time I demoed the HTC Vive Portal: Aperture Robot Repair demo. That feeling of shocking immersion is certainly ever-present. The PSVR lets you escape the world you currently occupy and warp into a fully 3D artificial existence. It works.'b""But, it can also make you dizzy. If the camera isn't tracking you well, the artificial floor can start to drift while playing. That's a weird feeling! It feels like you're drunk and can't hold yourself up.""b'Judging from my limited time with Oculus Rift but hours with the HTC Vive, I found the overall experience to be in the same ballpark as the other ""full VR"" hardware out there. I say this as it relates to the VR immersion -- not necessarily the visual fidelity. The Rift and Vive offer slightly higher screen resolutions and variable performance depending on PC specs. The PSVR, on the other hand, is locked into the same performance across the board because it\'s powered by a PS4.'b""The best part of the PSVR is its headset. Out of all the VR headsets I've worn I think this is the most comfortable, but certainly not the lightest. The headset has a slightly plasticky feel to it, but I wouldn't call it cheap. It seems to be able to adjust to most head sizes (note: I have what some call an enormous head and it fits fine) and I like its retractable band adjuster and sliding viewfinder. That said, I can't wear it -- or any other VR headset -- for more than 30 to 45 minutes tops, without getting the overwhelming sense that I need to take a break.""b""It's easy to muck up the lenses in the headset. Whether it was my eyelashes or just accidental smudges from adjusting it for comfort, I found myself cleaning the two lenses a lot. There's an included shammy for doing just that.""b""And then there's the sweating. Am I a person who sweats a lot normally? Yes. But everyone I've let try this thing ends up with a nice moist patch above their eyebrows. That's just the way it is. Is it a deal breaker? Not at all. Just don't spend an hour with the PSVR immediately before you need to look somewhat presentable. """,7.9,b'Jeff Bakalar',"Oct. 5, 2016 8:18 a.m. PT"
