b'DJI Phantom 3 Standard',b'Drones',CNET,"b""DJI Phantom 3 Standard review:\xc2\xa0An entry-level drone that's much better than basic""","b""DJI's ready-to-fly Phantom 3 Advanced and Professional camera drones are remarkably simple to operate, which makes them great for people entering the hobby. What's not so great: their prices.""b""To help out your poor credit card, DJI introduced the Phantom 3 Standard, a quadcopter that looks a lot like its linemates, but at $799 in the US, \xc2\xa3649 in the UK and AU$1,299 in Australia, it costs hundreds less. Also, to celebrate the company's 10th anniversary, DJI has cut the price to $499, AU$859 and \xc2\xa3449 with no end date set for the promotion. ""b""At its price, the Standard is tough to beat. You might be able to find a quadcopter with similar features from someone else, but it won't be as polished a product -- from unboxing to flight -- as the Phantom 3 Standard. ""b'The Phantom 3 Standard is the entry-level model.'b'That said, the Standard is the entry-level model and as such it has fewer features. For starters, it lacks the Visual Positioning System that the other Phantom 3s have that would have let you more easily fly it indoors without GPS. Similarly, the Standard uses only GPS for positioning outdoors, while the Professional and Advanced use GPS as well as GLONASS, a secondary satellite system for faster and more accurate positioning provided by GPS alone. 'b""The biggest difference is its controller, though. The one that comes with the Advanced and Professional models features DJI's Lightbridge technology for better video image transmission between the sky and ground as well as having a range of up to 5 kilometers (3.1 miles). ""b""In place of Lightbridge, the Standard's controller uses a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi range extender for transmitting the live view from the Standard to a mobile device, so the potential for a delay or loss of signal in the video downlink is greater. Plus, transmission range is cut down to a maximum 1,000 meters (0.62 mile). The remote controller operates on 5.8GHz frequency.""b""The Standard's controller.""b""Also, the higher-end controller has camera controls like buttons for starting and stopping recordings or taking snapshots in addition to two that are programmable. The Standard's controller is limited to an adjustment wheel for tilting the camera up and down with all other camera settings and controls handled via DJI's Go app for iOS and Android. There's also no discrete Return-to-Home button; one of the controller's switches can be used instead. (Here's where you can see the full feature breakdown by model.)""b""As for the Standard's camera, it uses a similar distortion-free, 94-degree, wide-angle f2.8 lens to the Pro and Advanced, but it has a maximum recording resolution of 2.7K HD video at 30 frames per second. That's the same maximum resolution as the Advanced, however that model can also do 1080p at 60fps; the Standard taps out at 1080p at 30fps. ""b'The Standard can also snap 12-megapixel photos in both Adobe DNG raw and JPEG formats. The Go app also lets you manually change shutter speed, exposure compensation and ISO and you can set it to do burst shooting, exposure bracketing and time-lapse photography.

b'DJI Spark',b'Drones',CNET,b'DJI Spark review:\xc2\xa0Ups the ante on selfie drones',"b""You know how Apple sometimes seems to be behind its competition in performance, design or features, only to eventually leapfrog them and take the lead? That's what DJI did with the Spark. ""b'While the company was concentrating on making higher-end camera drones for prosumers and professionals, other drone makers -- established and startup -- were creating highly portable drones for people who wanted cool aerial selfies (aka ""dronies"") without having to be an expert pilot. \xc2\xa0'b""DJI's $999 Mavic Pro seemed as close as the company would get to the category, with its compact folding design and intelligent subject tracking that let you capture selfies with a hand gesture. But then the Spark arrived in May and pretty much made everyone forget about all the selfie drones that came before it. It offers many of the Mavic's same features in a body that's roughly the size of a soda can. ""b""The Spark is aimed at the dronie crowd, but shares tech from the Mavic such as obstacle detection, dual-band GPS and a visual positioning system that lets it hover in place up to 98 feet (30 m) above the ground -- indoors or outside. Also, while the competition relies on electronic image stabilization alone, DJI put the Spark's full HD video camera on a two-axis motorized gimbal for smooth results without sacrificing image quality. And DJI took its gesture controls to the next level with the drone, too.""b""Priced at $499 in the US, AU$859 in Australia and \xc2\xa3519 in the UK, you don't get much more than the drone and a single battery. For $699 (AU$1,199, \xc2\xa3699), DJI bundles the Spark, extra props and a set of prop guards, two batteries and a charging hub for refreshing three batteries at once, a remote controller and a carry bag -- a savings of $154, according to DJI's site. ""b""The bundle is a good value and worth getting if you think you might want to do more than quick flights for selfies. Then again, the Mavic Pro is pretty close in price and can be flown farther, faster and for longer, it has a better camera and stabilization and folds up to a very travel-friendly size as well. Basically, if you're really interested in learning to fly a drone immediately for capturing spectacular photos and video, save up for the Mavic. The Spark is a great choice if your main goal is to get cool dronies, without limiting your opportunities to do more down the road. ""b'With its brightly colored shell -- white, blue, green, red or yellow -- and tiny frame, the Spark greatly lowers the intimidation factor. For new pilots, having something small that, out of the box, you can fly without having to learn any real controls whatsoever is a big deal. The Hover Camera Passport made a big splash at CES 2017 with its Owner Mode, which uses face detection for smartphone-free flying, and DJI does something similar here with its Gesture Mode. 'b'Fire up the quad, hold it out in front of you facing the camera and double-tap the power button. The camera gives a quick scan, locks onto your face and spins up its propellers (watch your fingers). Let go and the drone just hovers in front of you. 'b""To move the drone around, you hold up your palm to the camera and wait for the drone's front lights to turn green. Then you can move your hand up and down to raise and lower it and move your hand left or right to move it side to side. Give your hand a wave and the Spark will fly backwards away from you and then start tracking your movements. Make a frame shape with your thumbs and forefingers and it will snap a photo. Put your arm out to your side at a 45-degree angle with the ground and you can start and stop video recording. Put your hands in the air in a Y shape and it will return to you. Put your hand underneath it and it will land in your palm (again, watch your fingers). """,8.2,b'Joshua Goldman',"July 16, 2017 4:00 a.m. PT"
b'DJI Mavic Pro',b'Drones',CNET,b'DJI Mavic Pro review:\xc2\xa0A powerful flying camera anyone can take anywhere',"b""There have been several kinder, gentler camera drones this year -- from the large PowerVision PowerEgg to the compact Yuneec Breeze -- but the DJI Mavic Pro is the only one to combine high performance, lots of automated flight modes and obstacle avoidance in an ultracompact body. Add in DJI's assortment of safety and ease-of-use features and you've got a drone that anyone can take anywhere.""b""One of the few complaints I've had about the company's Phantom models is that they aren't particularly travel friendly, mainly due to the camera and gimbal position and the fixed landing gear. The Mavic doesn't have these issues and its propeller arms and the props themselves fold up so there's no need to remove them. ""b""The smaller size -- of both the drone and its controller -- and decidedly un-Phantom looks make it more approachable and less obtrusive.  The thing is, you still get nearly the same performance as you would from the company's top-of-the-line Phantom 4. It'll cost you about the same, too: $1,000 in the US, AU$1,700  in Australia and \xc2\xa31,100 in the UK.""b'The Phantom 4 has a higher maximum speed and can withstand stronger winds, and its camera has a wider field of view. The Mavic Pro is basically better in every other way, though. For example, its new OcuSync encrypted transmission system, gives you control up to 4.3 miles (7 km) away and streams video at 1080p. The Phantom 4 has a max range of 3.1 miles (5 km) and streams at 720p.'b'Also, while it might not have the power to cut through really strong winds (DJI says it can handle winds up to 19-24 mph or 29-38 kph), it was able to keep the camera stable and fly steady in 10-15 mph winds and still get between 22-25 minutes of flight time before it landed itself. It does warn you when the winds are too strong for its motors, too. 'b""Like the drone itself, the controller is very small, but still has a monochrome screen for important flight data and physical camera controls. Want to see what you're shooting? You can connect a phone and mount it just below the control sticks. Getting your phone in the mount is a bit of a pain and requires you to remove any case you might have on it, but it does mean your phone isn't blocking your view of the controls. ""b""DJI added a switch to change from RC to a Wi-Fi mode, so you can quickly launch and control the Mavic with only your phone at distances up to 80 meters (262 feet) with a top speed of 4 meters per second (13 feet per second). It's nice to have for things like quick selfies, but using the actual controller is better. """,8.5,b'Joshua Goldman',"Nov. 12, 2016 8:00 a.m. PT"
b'DJI Mavic Air',b'Drones',CNET,"b""DJI Mavic Air review:\xc2\xa0A folding 4K mini drone that's close to perfect""","b'The DJI Mavic Air is an easy-to-fly drone that shoots great 4K video, packed into an impossibly small package.'b""It's the latest -- and in many ways greatest -- consumer drone from DJI, the name that's effectively become for drones what Apple and Samsung are for smartphones. The Mavic Air effectively combines the best aspects of the company's top-end Mavic Pro -- my go-to consumer camera drone recommendation since it was introduced in October 2016 -- with the portability of its more casual-focused, travel-friendly\xc2\xa0Spark, while adding some great new capabilities to the mix, including better obstacle avoidance and an improved 4K video camera. ""b'Starting at $799, \xc2\xa3769 and AU$1,299, the Air is a clear step up from the Spark, but its position against the $999 Pro is more hazy. The Mavic Pro has a couple features the Air doesn\'t, but the opposite is also true. Mainly, the Pro has a slight edge on battery life and video transmission range and can record video at a ""true"" 4K resolution of 4,096x2,160 pixels. There\'s also a Pro Platinum edition that\'s quieter and flies a few minutes longer than the baseline Pro model.'b""The Air, on the other hand, is a much smarter drone than both the Spark and Mavic Pro thanks to new tech inside that not only makes it safer for you to fly, but keeps the drone itself out of harm's way as well. For nonprofessionals looking for a camera drone that does more than snap selfies, but is still amazingly compact for travel, the Mavic Air is just about perfect.\xc2\xa0 ""b'Mavic Air vs. soda can (4.8 in. (12.3 cm) tall).'b'Before diving into the features, let\'s talk battery life. The flight time for the Air is up to 21 minutes. That\'s in ideal conditions with no wind. In my testing, I typically got between 15 to 18 minutes of continuous flight with wind. You can, and probably should, buy extra batteries; DJI has a ""Fly More"" package for $999, \xc2\xa3949, AU$1,599 that adds additional propellers, two extra batteries and a multibattery charging hub. Few things are more disappointing than traveling out to a scenic spot only to run out of flight time. However, also keep in mind that a spare battery won\'t do you any good if you\'re 400 feet in the air over the ocean and running out of time to get back safely.\xc2\xa0 'b""There are several features unique to the Air, but its new SmartCapture mode is a good demo of its intelligence, letting you fly the drone with simple hand gestures. The Spark has a similar Gesture mode so you can launch and land the drone from your palm and take photos for video clips while it's in the air, all without a phone or controller. The Mavic Air's gestures give you more control than the Spark, though.\xc2\xa0 ""b'By moving your hands together or apart you can push and pull the Air.\xc2\xa0'b""You can enter SmartCapture mode through the DJI Go 4 mobile app or, thanks to a Feb. 9 firmware update, double press the light/button on back. Using your hands you can make the Air take off or land on the ground as well as fly it away from or toward you, increase its altitude and have it track your movements. Flashing a peace sign will snap a photo, while making a frame with your thumbs and forefingers will start and stop video recording. It's all very cool, but mostly as a way to get wows from your friends and family because much of this and more can be done just by flying it around with the mobile app.\xc2\xa0 ""b""What I find much more useful than SmartCapture are the drone's QuickShot flight modes, a group of preset flight paths that record short video clips while tracking a subject. There are six in all on the Air including two new ones -- Asteroid and Boomerang -- and to use them requires little more than tapping on the subject you want it to follow. The end results are bite-size videos great for sharing on social.\xc2\xa0 ""b'Asteroid QuickShot from the DJI Mavic Air pic.twitter.com/Hs0q2Fyhcd'b""While the automated QuickShot modes and SmartCapture are nice for occasional use, eventually you'll want to pick up and use its controller. It's similar to the Spark's in that it's small and simple and you need to also have an iOS or Android device for a screen. But it has removable sticks that store in the body of the controller for easier travel.\xc2\xa0 ""b""You get full control of the drone and a 720p-resolution view from its camera from up to 2.4 miles (4 km) away -- twice the range of the Spark. While having the option to fly with just your phone is nice, using the controller is much more enjoyable. Plus, it leaves your whole screen for flight data and framing your shots and adds physical controls for controlling the camera on back. It also gives you access to the drone's Sport mode, which lets you fly at up to 42.5 mph (68.4 kph). ""b""Pull down the mobile device holders on the controller and you'll find its removable sticks.\xc2\xa0""b""The thing is, even pilots who know how to control a drone still get into trouble with obstacles. That's where the Mavic Air's system of seven -- seven! -- built-in cameras and infrared sensors comes into play, helping to map the drone's environment so it knows just where it is and where obstacles are as well.\xc2\xa0 """,8.8,b'Joshua Goldman',"Feb. 12, 2018 6:31 a.m. PT"
b'Parrot MiniDrone Rolling Spider',b'Drones',CNET,b'Parrot MiniDrone Rolling Spider review:\xc2\xa0Inexpensive drone fun for novice flyers',"b"" \t \tIt would be easy enough to dismiss Parrot's MiniDrone  \tRolling Spider as just another mini-quadcopter. And at $100 (AU$140, \xc2\xa390) it would be a pricey one, too, considering you can get a basic mini-quadcopter for less than $30.""b"" \t \tBut, despite appearances, the Rolling Spider isn't an ordinary mini-quadcopter. For starters, it's controlled entirely with your smartphone or tablet and not a typical two-stick radio controller. And it's generally a lot of fun, except for its biggest problem: flight times of 8 minutes or less (which is the lifespan of the single included rechargeable battery). ""b' \tInside, Parrot used an ultrasonic sensor, a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer, a vertical camera, and a pressure sensor, which combine to make flight very stable -- indoors and outside.'b' \tThen there are the wheels that give this MiniDrone the ""Rolling"" part of its name. Attach the wheels to the top of the Spider and you can drive it around on the ground or even drive it up a wall and across the ceiling. While that\'s fun, it\'s probably more important that they give the propellers some protection while you\'re flying around indoors, since those are typically the first thing you\'ll need to replace.'b' \tAnd  \tyou will need to buy more propellers because you only get one set with the Rolling Spider. In the box along with with the MiniDrone and wheels you get one battery, a Micro-USB cable, and some stickers so you can dress up your MiniDrone.  Accessories coming in September include batteries at $20 each (AU$22, \xc2\xa314), replacement propellers for $6 a set, and replacement wheels for $10.'b"" \t \t \tLike Parrot's larger AR.Drone quadcopters, the Rolling Spider is completely controlled with an app on your smartphone or tablet. The  \tFreeFlight 3.0 app is available for iOS, Android, and, in October, Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 devices; I did all my testing with a  Galaxy S4  and an  iPhone 5S .""b"" \t \tThe Spider connects to your phone or tablet via Bluetooth. The whole process is pretty automatic: Turn on the Spider, turn on Bluetooth on your device, and open the app. It should automatically connect to your device and once it does you launch the controller and you're off.""b"" \t \tFor flying, which can be done with or without the wheels attached, you tap the Take Off button and it will start the propellers and send the Spider straight up and start hovering. And it does this out of the box unlike other mini-quadcopters. There's no need to adjust trim or anything else: It will just hover in place, which is a big reason why it's so easy to fly.""b"" \t \tIn its default Normal mode, the joystick on the right lets you raise and lower the Spider as well as rotate it left and right. To move it forward, back, left, and right, you keep your thumb pressed down on the right joystick and tilt your device the direction you want it to go. If it starts to travel somewhere you don't want it to, don't panic, just lift your thumbs off the controls and it will stop and hover.""",7.5,b'Joshua Goldman',"Aug. 20, 2014 4:10 p.m. PT"

It's very easy to get out of the sky (safely, I mean). You can fly it with your phone. You can check things out in first-person view with the companion VR goggles. It's significantly cheaper than other drones with 4K cameras. It's close to a perfect laundry list for an entry-level drone or a casual pilot.""b""You'll fly the drone via a companion app, and that's also where the headset becomes important. You'll pair your device to the headset, rather than the drone, which means that for compatibility across iOS and Android, you'll only need to pick up another headset, not an entirely new drone. The law dictates you need to keep the drone in line of sight while you're flying it, so this is strictly a two-man operation.""b""The VR headset is gimmicky, but it's an excellent inclusion if you find yourself with a young kid as your co-pilot. Or, let's be honest, a drunk adult as your co-pilot. The headset offers a live feed from the drone's onboard camera, and what's more, you can control the camera angle by moving your head. I had a couple of connectivity issues with the video feed, but the novelty far outweighed the troubleshooting.""b'It\'s worth noting that in the UK and Australia, you aren\'t allowed to wear the headset while you\'re piloting the drone, so it\'s really leaning on providing a group experience. That normally only extends as far as ""watch me fly my drone. No, you can\'t have a turn,"" so it was nice to be able to offer something to anyone out flying with you.

b'Odyssey Toys X-7 Microlite',b'Drones',CNET,b'Odyssey Toys X-7 Microlite review:\xc2\xa0Sprightly microdrone lights up the night',"b' \tThe X-7 Microlite quadcopter from Odyssey Toys is the kind of thing I would expect to see someone hawking on a carnival midway. With its propellers shielded for protection and ringed in bright LED lights, the palm-size quadcopter is stable enough to just toss into the air and quickly send it hovering around a crowd of onlookers as it dips and flips and rolls with ease.'b"" \tIt's at that point you'd reach into your pocket and hand over $60 (roughly \xc2\xa340 or AU$80) for your very own chance to perform such aerial maneuvers, and you'd probably be happy that you did. You'll have to buy four AA-size batteries for the controller, which is essentially the same length and width of the drone itself, but otherwise it's ready to go out of the box. ""b"" \tThe drone's small 3.7-volt 500mAh rechargeable battery gets you about 7 minutes of flying, which will send you running to a USB charger to refuel for about 45 minutes. The flight time is short, but average for this size drone, so picking up spare batteries and a charger isn't a bad idea. ""b""The X-7 can fly indoors or outside, but only as long as there's little wind to speak of. It's relatively easy to hover and beginners can use a low-speed setting to get a feel for its performance. It won't be long before you're doing flips and rolls, which require no more than a button press and a quick push of the controller's right stick. The lights and overall design are nice, and a bit different than your average microquad (except maybe this one). It handles crashes and hard landings well, too, though you might end up with cracks in its plastic frame.

It can also be programmed to follow a Road Plan or complete pre-programmed tricks.""b"" \t \t \tAnd then there's the jumping. Though you can have the Sumo balance on its wheels like a Segway when driving it around, it will spend most of its time resting on its rear leg. With a tap on your screen that leg will retract, compressing its two springs and then releasing them, launching itself either forward or straight up 80cm (2.6 feet). You can also have the Sumo flip itself over and use the leg to kick a ball or irritate friends and family by kicking their feet.""b"" \t \t \tLike Parrot's larger AR.Drone quadcopters and  MiniDrone Rolling Spider , the Jumping Sumo is completely controlled with an app on your smartphone or tablet.

b'Yuneec Typhoon Q500 4K',b'Drones',CNET,b'Yuneec Typhoon Q500 4K review:\xc2\xa0A very fine 4K camera for the ground and the sky',"b"" \tCamera options for your average consumer drone are limited to either a mount for a GoPro or similar camera or a built-in camera that is permanently attached to the drone. The former is fine, though it may or may not give you a first-person view (FPV) from the air and it's one more thing to keep charged (and you'll have to figure in the extra cost of the camera). The latter, however, means you've got no upgrade path should a better camera come along, and it can only be used with the drone.""b"" \tYuneec's Typhoon Q500 4K is not your average drone. Slung from the belly of the $1,300 quadcopter (\xc2\xa3960 AU$2,200) is a 4K-resolution camera combined with a three-axis antivibration gimbal. When not in the air, the camera-and-gimbal system can be quickly removed and attached to the included SteadyGrip, a battery-powered handheld mount that lets you use the Typhoon's camera on the ground. Combined with an iPhone or Android smartphone, you can shoot completely control the camera and see what you're shooting. (Yuneec makes an updated and improved version of the SteadyGrip called  ActionCam with a built-in rechargeable battery and the Q500 4K's CGO3 camera.)""b"" \tThe  DJI Inspire 1  series takes a similar approach, but it's targeted at professionals and starts at about $2,700 for the drone and the handheld camera mount is an additional $270. The Typhoon Q500 4K is a better option for beginners, giving you an aerial and ground imaging solution that, while maybe not as feature-filled as some competing models, does what it does very well.""b' \tThe Q500 4K is big. Not like ""How does that thing get off the ground?"" big, but next to the relatively compact DJI Phantom 3, it\'s big. (The diagonal motor-to-motor measurement is 390mm for the Phantom compared to the Typhoon\'s 510mm.) The size does make it easier to spot in the sky from a distance, but you\'re not sliding the Q500 4K easily into a backpack for a trip to the park.'b"" \tInstead Yuneec packs everything into a large, sturdy case. Along with the drone and its camera you'll find two batteries and a charger; two sets of propellers; the ST10+ controller, a neck strap and sunshield; a cable to use the charger in a car; and the SteadyGrip handheld mount. Unfortunately, Yuneec used Styrofoam inside the case instead of something a bit more long-lasting.""b"" \tThe Styrofoam is representative of the design and build quality on the whole: it's a good package overall, but lacks some polish. The black-and-gray plastic body looks nice, but pick it up and it feels a little flimsy. It's great that the camera can be removed, but to do it you have to keep plugging and unplugging this small cable and pushing in a plastic tab, both of which I feel might not last with frequent use. Nothing that's a deal breaker, but a little disappointing.""b"" \tThe controller for me is definitely a plus, though. Instead of relying on a tablet or smartphone for a live view from the camera as well as flight information, the ST10+ has a built-in 5.5-inch touchscreen display built right in. There's a bit of lag between the camera and screen, so I wouldn't recommend flying by FPV alone, but for setting up shots and giving you telemetry data at a glance it's great. It also means you only have to worry about having the controller charged, not a second device.""b"" \tHaving the fixed screen does mean you can't go with a larger tablet display, but since the drone doesn't support waypoint navigation -- where a larger screen to set up an autonomous flight path comes in handy -- and FPV flying isn't a great idea, it's not a big loss.""b' \tThe controller also has buttons for starting and stopping video recording and snapping photos and sliders for setting the camera angle and limiting overall climb/descend and directional speed. A switch lets you move between flight modes: Smart, Angle and Home.'b"" \tSmart mode is made for beginners. In addition to enabling a virtual barrier called a geofence to prevent it from flying more than 300 feet away from the pilot, the controller will always move the Q500 4K in the direction the right-hand control stick is pushed relative to the pilot and no matter which way the nose is pointed. It's fine if you've never flown before and you use it just to get a feel for how the quadcopter will fly, but I don't recommend using it much beyond that.""b"" \tHowever, Smart mode is the only way you can use two of the drone's main attractions: Follow Me and Watch Me modes. With Follow Me, the drone uses a GPS signal from controller to follow whoever or whatever is carrying it. Watch Me mode works similarly, but keeps the controller -- or whoever's holding it -- framed in the camera no matter where and how it moves and the camera can automatically tilt according to the controller.""",7.8,b'Joshua Goldman',"Nov. 12, 2015 4:14 p.m. PT"

'b""With little more than some taps on your phone's screen, you can put the Breeze in the air and have it perform a handful of automated camera moves to grab photos and video clips of you and your friends and family. Then you just download them to your phone, edit and share -- all from within the drone's app. ""b""You can also fly it around manually with onscreen controls if you want to get specific aerial shots, but the range is limited to a maximum height of 80 meters (262.5 feet) and maximum distance of 100 meters (328.1 feet). Flight times tap out at 12 minutes, so you won't want to fly it too far away from you anyway. ""b""The Breeze is not a toy, though. Its price tag pretty much quells that notion: $500 in the US and AU$700 or \xc2\xa3450 in Australia  and the UK, respectively.  It's not for racing around, either, and it's also not going to compete with something like the DJI Phantom 3 Standard, which is priced similarly, but has a better camera stabilized with a three-axis gimbal and far greater range and capabilities. ""b""However, the DJI isn't going to slip into a shoulder bag or backpack and is not nearly as discreet as the Breeze. It's basically a point-and-shoot camera attached to a flying robot -- a selfie drone. ""b""The mobile app, available for iOS and Android, is split into two sections: Tasks and Gallery. Tap on Tasks and you're given five options to choose from: Pilot, Selfie, Orbit, Journey and Follow Me. Pilot has the manual controls for flying around the way any other drone would with a regular controller. However, the Breeze is designed to have the camera pointed at you and not away from you like other camera drones, so the controls are reversed. (An onscreen toggle quickly switches this to what experienced pilots would consider normal.) ""b""Selfie mode takes away the traditional stick controls and uses sliders instead to get the camera into just the right position for your photo or video. Orbit lets you set up the Breeze to automatically circle you or another subject, while Journey sets the copter to fly away from you and back again using the camera's angle to calculate its trajectory.
