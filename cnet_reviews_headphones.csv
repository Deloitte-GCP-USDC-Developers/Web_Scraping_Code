b'Apple AirPods Pro',b'Headphones',CNET,"b'AirPods Pro, 9 months later: These headphones still rock'","b""Apple's AirPods Pro ($249, \xc2\xa3249, AU$399) first hit the market in late October 2019. A lot has changed in the world since then and new competitors have arrived on the scene. But not much has changed about the way I feel about these earbuds. The AirPods Pro are Apple's first headphones to offer active noise cancellation, which electronically counteracts exterior noise like the hum of a jet engine or an air conditioner, and the company's first wireless model to feature a noise-isolating design -- with silicone ear tips that push into your ear canal. They remain a safe choice for Apple users looking for a compact, lightweight pair of true wireless earbuds that connect easily to their Apple devices and perform well -- both for music and movie listening as well as making voice calls.""b""Yes, they're a little overpriced. But the good news is we're seeing them regularly discounted by $25 to $35 at various online retailers. Also, Apple announced recently that this fall, with the release of iOS 14, they'll get automatic switching between Apple devices and a new spatial audio surround sound feature that takes advantage of some internal tech we didn't know the AirPods Pro had: Along with built-in accelerometers, it turns out they also have built-in gyroscopes. That will allow for head tracking, a feature usually found on higher-end gaming headphones, allowing the AirPods Pro the potential to create a more realistic surround-sound experience (I'm still waiting to try it out). The\xc2\xa0standard AirPods, which cost about $100 less, won't get the new virtual surround sound feature, though they will be upgraded with automatic switching.""b'After living with the AirPods Pro for many months and comparing them to a slew of competitors, my conclusions remain largely the same. Here are some key takeaways.'b'Read more:\xc2\xa0The best true wireless earbuds of 2019'b'The original AirPods on the left, the new AirPods Pro on the right.'b""I'm one of those people whose ears aren't ideal receptacles for the original AirPods, which are now on their second generation. I can wear them, but they don't stay in my ears all that well. I feel them start to fall out if I do anything too strenuous in them, like dash across the street to make a light. ""b""With the AirPods Pro, I don't have that problem. They fit my ears securely. I can run with them -- and they're sweat-proof, Apple says (they have an IPX4 water-resistance rating, which means they're splashproof but not waterproof). It's also worth noting that they come with small, medium and large ear tips. I was worried I'd need an extra-large tip to get a tight seal, but the AirPods Pro's large ear tips fit my ears fine. That said, in the last few months, I did upgrade the tips with  ($30) specially made for the AirPods Pro that allowed me to get an even tighter seal and an even more secure (I found that one bud started to slip out of my ear on longer runs). Comply also makes  and some cheaper foam tips are available for less than $15. However, I can't vouch for those, having only tried the CharJenPro and Comply tips.""b'Read more: Best AirPods Pro accessories of 2020'b""If you're setting them up on an iOS device, in fact, the app will guide you through testing which ear tip fits you best. And Apple is selling its own replacement tips for just $4 (for a set of three pairs), so replacing them when they eventually get, well, gross is eminently affordable.""b""The long and short of it is the new design will fit more ears than the original AirPods. I hesitate to call it a universal fit because there are always exceptions, but they're close. The only issue is that some people simply don't like having silicone buds stuck in their ears, even if they're as soft and pliant as these tips are. That's the reason why so many people like the original AirPods. They just sort of nestle in your ear -- and when they fit right, they're really comfortable. However, a few of my coworkers said that even though the AirPods Pro sounded better, they still preferred the fit of the regular AirPods. ""b""The first thing you notice about the AirPods Pro is that they sound better than the standard AirPods\xc2\xa0because they have more bass. The reason they have more bass is largely due to their new noise-isolating design and new drivers that are tuned for that design. The standard AirPods sound decent enough in quiet places but due to their open design, they just don't do well when confronted with external noise (the bass frequencies get drowned out). The AirPods' noise cancellation, which is effective, also helps with external noise, and the combination of the seal of the tips and the active noise cancellation means they sound much better in noisier environments such as city streets.\xc2\xa0""b'Read more: AirPods Pro vs. standard AirPods -- which should you buy?'b'The Ear Tip Fit test helps determine which size is right for your ears.\xc2\xa0'b""Don't get me wrong, I like the way the AirPods Pro sound. They're pleasant to listen to -- very good for true wireless. But they lack the clarity, definition and more textured sound one might expect from headphones that cost $250. In short, there are competing models that cost around the same price or less that sound as good or better. That doesn't mean those competing models are better overall -- there are other factors to consider -- but just understand that from a pure sound standpoint, there are superior options.\xc2\xa0""b'I compared the AirPods Pro to its closest current competitor, the\xc2\xa0Sony WF-1000XM3, which also has adaptive noise-canceling features. The WF-1000XM3 sounds better -- its sound is bigger, smoother and more refined overall, and easier to listen to over longer listening sessions.'b'Read more: Best noise-canceling true wireless earbuds of 2020'b""The Sony WF-1000XM3's noise-canceling mode is as effective as that of the AirPods Pro. And the Sony's battery life is rated a little higher (6 hours), possibly because they're larger. With active noise cancellation on, Apple says AirPods Pro will deliver up to 4.5 hours of listening. We were able to eke out 5 hours and 9 minutes in our battery test with music playing at 75% volume level (you can watch the test in our YouTube video). While more battery life would ideally be better, it isn't a big issue because the buds charge quickly in their case and a 5-minute charge via the Lightning port or a Qi wireless charging pad (yes, they feature wireless charging) will get you an hour of battery life. A USB-C to Lightning cable is included, but you'll need to supply an adapter\xc2\xa0or plug them into a USB-C laptop if you don't have a wireless charging pad.""b""Since I wrote my initial review of the AirPods Pro, Sennheiser released its second-gen\xc2\xa0Momentum True Wireless 2 ($300), which has better sound than the AirPods Pro and equally effective noise-canceling. Several other compelling noise-canceling true wireless earbuds have hit the market, including the Technics EAH-AZ70W ($250), and more premium noise-canceling models will arrive before the year's end. Fit is a big factor when it comes to noise-isolating earphones: If you don't get a tight seal and good fit (with any of these models), the noise cancellation and sound quality both take a big hit. Some of these other earphones sound better, but it's hard to beat the AirPods Pro's lightweight design and comfortable fit.\xc2\xa0""b'Settings you can access from your iPhone.'b""The AirPods and their charging case are significantly smaller and lighter than the Sonys. The charging case is wider than the standard AirPods' case and a little thicker, but it's still a small package. And size matters when it comes to these types of earphones. The case and the AirPods are literally half the size of the Sonys. There's something appealing about that. Although the Sonys fit me well, the AirPods Pro seem more likely to fit more ears comfortably.""b""Side note: You can wear the left and right earbuds independently of each other (that is, wear one bud at a time), and Apple's new Audio Sharing feature allows a friend with a compatible set of Apple or Beats headphones to connect to your iOS device to listen to the same content that you are.""b""The standard AirPods are quite good for making calls. With the release of the second-gen model this year -- some call them the AirPods 2 -- Apple improved their noise-reduction capabilities, particularly wind noise. The AirPods Pro have three microphones on each bud, one of which is a beamforming mic that's designed to pick up your voice. They also have similar noise-reduction capabilities, plus a vent system that's not only supposed to relieve some of the pressure that can build up in your ear from a noise-isolating design coupled with noise-canceling features, but can help cut down on wind noise a tad, an Apple rep told me. More importantly, you can simply hear callers better because of the Pros' noise-isolating design.""b""Call quality has been the Sony WF-1000XM3's Achilles heel. It's gotten better with some firmware upgrades, but it should be even better -- it's not up to the AirPods Pro's standard. In terms of making calls, the AirPods are top-notch. But others are catching up. I tested these against the Anker Liberty Air 2\xc2\xa0earbuds. The Ankers and their more expensive sibling, the Liberty 2 Pro, measured up well to the AirPods when it came to making calls. Like the AirPods Pro, the Liberty Air 2 earbuds do a good job of muffling ambient noise (callers said they could hear me fine even with a lot of street and even construction noise around me). They don't sound quite as good as the AirPods Pro, nor do they have active noise-canceling, but they fit comfortably and their noise-isolating design passively seals out a lot of ambient noise. They only cost $90.\xc2\xa0""b""The only thing the AirPods seem to be missing on the call front is a sidetone feature that allows you to hear your voice in the earphones when you're making a call. That allows you to modulate your voice accordingly and not talk too loudly. Amazon's Echo Buds ($130), also good for making calls, have this feature, and so do the pricier Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2, which are also good for making calls.""b'The Pros have shorter stems.\xc2\xa0'b""I've been getting a lot of questions from readers about just how good the AirPods Pro noise-canceling is and whether it's better than what you get from full-size headphones like the Sony WH-1000XM3 and Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 or Bose QuietComfort 35 II. I was generally impressed with AirPod Pro's noise cancellation. In open office environments and in other places, like a cafe where people are talking around you, I didn't think there was much of a difference when I switched between the AirPods Pro and those larger headphones. They all do a decent job, although you can still hear people's voices.\xc2\xa0""b""I think the full-size headphones and even Sony's WF-1000XM3 do a better job muffling low frequencies. I haven't used the AirPods Pro on a plane yet, but I have a noisy HVAC unit in my apartment, and the Sony and Bose full-size headphones did a better job quieting its loud hum.\xc2\xa0""b""As far as airplane use goes, the AirPods Pro would certainly help with noise reduction, but just be aware there's no way to plug these into an in-flight entertainment system. You'd have to hook up a Bluetooth transceiver to the headphone jack. But the Pros will absolutely be better on a plane than standard AirPods, which are all but useless thanks to their open design.""b""Also, if you're sensitive to active noise cancellation, you may not be able to use these with it turned on. (There's no way to adjust it to a lower setting like there is with the Sony WF-1000XM3; it automatically adapts to your environment.) You can turn the setting off, however, and just live with the isolation delivered by the ear tips.""b""Earlier this year, there was some controversy over whether one of Apple's firmware upgrades had downgraded the AirPods Pro's noise-canceling. Some users swore it did. Subsequently, Apple released another firmware update that some say fixed the problem and others say it didn't. I personally think it's as good as it was when the AirPods Pro launched. But I do have a tighter seal, thanks to using those foam tips I mentioned earlier.""b'The standard AirPods have touch controls. You tap or tap and hold a touch zone on the side of the bud. The AirPods Pro have a force sensor in the stem of each bud -- and the stems are shorter, which is good. You pinch the stem to activate the controls. Pinch twice quickly to advance a track forward. Press and hold to turn noise cancellation on or off or to toggle a transparency mode that allows sound to leak in (so you can hear train announcements, for example, or just talk to someone while you have your AirPods on).'b""The new controls take a little getting used to, especially if you're coming from the standard AirPods and like their controls. Apple says it moved to the force sensors in the stem because the noise-isolating design meant you could hear the tapping when you touched the buds, which irritated people. Some people might not be happy with that decision, but I was fine with the new control method. I had some mishaps at first but I'm doing better after a few days of use.\xc2\xa0""b'You can also program the press-and-hold function to call up Siri manually if you don\'t want the always-on (hands-free) Siri feature to be active. Like the AirPods, the Pros have Apple\'s H1 chip that allows for always-on Siri, so you can call up Apple\'s voice assistant simply by saying ""Hey, Siri.""\xc2\xa0That\'s how you adjust volume levels -- by telling Siri. Otherwise, you have to make volume adjustments on your device.\xc2\xa0'b'Apple says the air vents on the inside of the buds help release some pressure.'b""Even with their easy pairing features, the original AirPods weren't immune to Bluetooth glitches and the occasional dropouts. I used my review sample with an iPhone 11 Pro running the latest version of iOS 13 (you have to have 13.2 or higher) and didn't have any real audio dropouts during my limited testing period. Audio syncing in video apps was also solid. There wasn't any lag that I saw, though I didn't try every video app.""b""Like the AirPods, you can use the AirPods Pro with Android phones (I used them with a Galaxy 9 Plus). The auto Bluetooth pairing feature isn't available and the always-on Siri feature doesn't work. But they work like normal Bluetooth earphones and you can use your phone's voice assistant. The noise-canceling works the same as it does with an iOS device.""b""I connected to a Mac without a problem but I haven't tried the AirPods Pro with a Windows machine yet.\xc2\xa0""b""If you like your current AirPods and they fit your ears well, you don't need to run out and buy the Pros. (I'd wait for your AirPods to die, which they will sooner rather than later if you use them a lot.) But if you've been eyeing the $199 AirPods with Wireless Charging, I'd pass them by and go straight to the Pros. The Pros have a wireless charging case too, and their superior sound and added features are worth the extra dough. ""b""The big question is this: How low will the standard AirPods (without wireless charging) go? They list for $160 but they often cost less, and we've seen them for as low as $130. As their price creeps down, I'd say those are the AirPods to get if you don't want to spend too much money on AirPods. Forget the wireless charging. It's an overrated feature and should cost less.\xc2\xa0 ""b'The Powerbeats Pro.'b'Many people were looking for better sound and a more secure fit than the original AirPods and they could get both in the Beats Powerbeats Pro. Apple owns Beats, and the Powerbeats Pro earbuds have bigger bass than the standard AirPods. They also have more dynamic sound as well as long battery life in a sporty design. The Powerbeats Pro cost $250 but get discounted sporadically\xc2\xa0and should be available for $200 or less as we head into the holiday buying season.'b'The Powerbeats Pro earbuds are still impressive, but the big strike against them is their bulky charging case. With their sweat-resistant design, bolder sound and more secure fit, the AirPods Pro are a direct competitor. The smaller size and more discreet profile of the AirPods Pro makes them the more appealing choice than the Beats. I also think some people will prefer their sound to the Powerbeats Pro, which is more hyped in the treble (maybe a little too hyped for some).\xc2\xa0'b""I'd only get the Powerbeats if I was worried about losing a bud doing an activity like mountain biking where there's a higher probability of one falling out of your ears. The Powerbeats Pro's ear hooks do help keep the earphones on your head.""b'With seemingly all of Apple\'s products, you have to separate the marketing hype from reality. This isn\'t the first in-ear true-wireless with noise-canceling. Sony\'s had earphones with the feature for around two years and several noise-canceling models are now available with more on the way, including inexpensive ones like the $60\xc2\xa0 (their noise-canceling is only so-so but they do sound good and work well for making calls). The Jabra Elite 75t, Sony WF-1000XM3, Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus and plenty of others have such a ""hear-through"" feature. So when Apple says ""magic you\'ve never heard"" and talks about a ""customizable fit"" because three different sized eartips are included, I kind of roll my eyes.\xc2\xa0'b""But even if they don't sound as magical as you'd hope a $250 model would, the AirPods Pro still manage to be a great pair of truly wireless earphones. That's largely due to their winning design and fit, improved bass performance, effective noise-canceling and excellent call quality. Yeah, they're expensive at $250, but the good news is you'll use them so much you'll probably wear the battery down -- it does degrade over time and isn't replaceable -- and have to buy a new pair in 18 to 24 months, if you don't lose them first.""b'Originally posted November 2019.

b'Sony WH-1000XM3',b'Headphones',CNET,b'Sony WH-1000XM3 review:\xc2\xa0Sony lays claim to top noise-canceling headphone',"b""For more than a year Sony's WH-1000XM3 has been the highest-rated wireless noise-canceling headphone on CNET, and it's still my favorite overall. It's still hard to beat its combination of design, features and performance -- both its sound and noise-canceling capabilities. Priced at $350, \xc2\xa3330 or AU$499, the WH-1000XM3 is regularly discounted to $300 and sometimes less.\xc2\xa0""b""Several top noise-canceling models, including Bose's Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, arrived in 2019. When I reviewed the Bose I compared the two in depth and they ended up neck-and-neck overall. The Sony WH-1000XM3 was slightly more comfortable, with better battery life (30 hours compared to the Bose's 20) and meatier bass sound. Meanwhile the Bose 700 has a sturdier headband, always-on Alexa voice assistant as an option, more detailed sound and superior performance for making calls. The biggest difference is price: The Bose is currently $400, so the Sony is definitely the superior value.""b""In 2020 we should see a new Sony WH-1000X -- the fourth-gen model, or M4 -- that will hopefully address some of its small drawbacks, including that slightly disappointing headset performance and a set of touch controls that can be adversely impacted by cold temperatures. It's unclear when it will arrive, but in the meantime it's safe to expect more discounts on this M3 model.""b'Read: Best noise-canceling headphones\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0'b""As I said when I first reviewed the WH-1000XM3 in October 2018, it seems as if Sony's engineers went through CNET's 2017 review of the\xc2\xa0WH-1000MX2 and corrected each small issue I had with it. The biggest design change is to the shape of the headband and padding on the ear cups. The headband is now more contoured to your head, and the headphone has shaved off 20 grams of weight. The padding on the ear cups is also a little softer.\xc2\xa0""b""The end result is a headphone that's clearly more comfortable than its predecessor. ""b'Sony has changed the shape of the headband. The WH-1000MX2 (left) has a more rounded shape while the WH-1000MX3 (right) has a more oval shape.'b""The Bose QuietComfort 35 II\xc2\xa0from 2018 is still lighter at 235 grams versus 254 grams for this. But Sony is now neck-and-neck with Bose in terms of comfort, which had been one of Bose's advantages.  The other big change is that Sony has moved from Micro-USB to USB-C charging. As part of the switch, there's a new quick-charge feature that gives you 5 hours of use from a 10-minute charge. That's pretty impressive -- and the 30 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels is also great. ""b'I was critical of the headset performance in my review of the earlier 1000X models. For the WH-1000XM3, the engineers shifted to a new multimicrophone array system that filters out background noise while picking up your voice during calls. I made several calls, and headset performance definitely has improved and has now become more of a strength than a weakness.'b""There are a few other cosmetic changes. The exterior finish on the ear cups, where you'll find the touch controls, is smoother. And the carrying case is slightly different. It reserves a spot for the short USB-C cable as well as the included headphone cable -- yes, you can use this as a wired headphone, great for the plane's in-flight entertainment system -- and it sounds great in wired mode.  Sony reps told me this model has the same drivers as its excellent MDR-1AM2 headphone, and I think this sounds better than the Bose QuietComfort 35 II: it sounds more natural with a little better definition, clarity and strong, punchy bass. There is some bass push -- I found myself wanting to lower the volume on one our test bass tracks, Alt-J's 3WW, to tone things down a bit. But the bass doesn't get boomy, it's just muscular. Overall, the headphone is clean-sounding for a Bluetooth headphone and sounds nice and open (for a closed-back headphone anyway). ""b""I gave the headphone to Steve Guttenberg, who writes CNET's The Audiophiliac column, for a listen. Steve can be hard on Bluetooth headphones but had positive things to say about the WH-1000XM3: Nice treble, warm, natural midrange and bass that was deep but also defined. He didn't have any real complaints about the sound. """,9.0,b'David Carnoy',"Nov. 22, 2019 9:06 a.m. PT"
b'Sony WF-1000XM3',b'Headphones',CNET,b'Sony WF-1000XM3 review:\xc2\xa0A top-notch true wireless headphone with active noise cancellation',"b""Sony hasn't been much of a player in the true wireless (AirPods-style) headphone arena, but its new WF-1000XM3 ($178 at Amazon) may change that. While it's not cheap at $230, it's the best-sounding set of truly wireless earbuds at this price, matching and perhaps even exceeding the performance of pricier competitors from Sennheiser, Beats, Master & Dynamic and Bang & Olufsen. Needless to say, it crushes the AirPods' sound, and has a feature the AirPods don't have: Active noise cancellation.\xc2\xa0""b""That's a big deal for the true wireless headphone category: With the exception of Sony's earlier and somewhat underwhelming\xc2\xa0WF-1000X\xc2\xa0and WF-SP700N, the new WF-1000XM3 are the only true wireless headphones with the feature. Bose has announced its\xc2\xa0Noise Cancelling Earbuds 700, but they won't ship until sometime in 2020.""b""If you did a double-take on the model number, that's because Sony also makes a popular over-ear noise-canceling headphone called the WH-1000XM3, the current CNET Editors' Choice for full-size noise-canceling headphones. For this new true wireless model, Sony skipped the Mark 2 and went straight to the Mark 3 in an effort to unify the current model numbers of its flagship 1000X headphone line.""b'The WF-1000XM3 is available in beige (pictured) or black.'b""I'm fine with that because the WF-1000XM3 has a very different design from the original WF-1000X. It's a totally new headphone with a new charging case (the earphones come in black and beige color), new drivers, new touch controls and a new QN1e processor that improves both the noise-canceling effect and the sound quality. They use Bluetooth 5.0.""b""Not everybody is going to love that design. It mixes both modern and retro aesthetics and the earphones aren't as discreet as say, the Jabra Elite 65t or Elite Active 65t. They stick out of your ears more than some true wireless earphones, which made me feel a little geeky. But they did fit my ears securely and I found them comfortable to wear.""b""It's important to note that with these earphones it's crucial to get a tight seal to get optimal sound quality and optimal noise canceling. As with the\xc2\xa0Beats Powerbeats Pro, you will likely be disappointed by the performance without a tight seal.""b'Tips galore -- but no XL.'b'To help ensure that you get a better fit, you get an assortment of ear tips, and one should fit your ears. Truth be told, none of the provided tips quite worked for me. I used a set of XL tips I had on hand that are little wider than the largest tip Sony provides. That extra bit of width enabled my ear canal to be sealed off and made all the difference for both sound quality and noise canceling.\xc2\xa0'b""A note about the charging case. It's a little bulky but does have a nice premium feel to it and the buds are easy to get in and out of it. Battery life has improved from the WF-1000X. At moderate volume levels, Sony says you can get up to 6 hours with noise canceling on and up to 8 hours with it off (my tests confirmed those numbers). There's also USB-C charging, with a 10-minute quick-charge feature giving you 90 minutes of battery life. The charging case delivers three full charges on the go.\xc2\xa0""b'A bit geeky.'b""There are touch controls on each earpiece, but no volume controls -- you have to use your phone for that. Some people may find that irritating; I personally don't care that much about having volume controls on the buds. You tap the right touchpad to control audio playback, access your voice assistant and answer and end calls. Tapping the right pad allows you to toggle through three sound modes: noise-canceling mode on, noise-canceling mode off and a transparency mode that lets ambient sound in. You can also change the sound modes and adjust noise-canceling levels using the Sony Headphone Connect app for Android or iOS.""b'Read more: The best-sounding true wireless headphones of 2019'b""Like the AirPods, Beats PowerBeats Pro, Jabra Elite 65t and other some other true wireless models, the earbuds have a sensor that detects when the bud is in your ear and when it's not.

b'Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700',b'Headphones',CNET,b'Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 review:\xc2\xa0Top noise-canceling headphones take it up just a notch',"b""The Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, the long-awaited successor to its\xc2\xa0QuietComfort 35 II\xc2\xa0models, have a lot to live up to. The QuietComfort series is almost 20 years old and is essentially the gold standard for active noise-canceling headphones, beloved by airline travelers and open-office residents the world over for their ability to block out a good chunk of external distractions. Simply put, the QC35s are a hard act to follow, and some people aren't going to like all the changes that Bose has made in creating this new successor headphone.\xc2\xa0""b""They also won't like the new, higher price: The Bose 700 is $400 (\xc2\xa3350 or about AU$570), which is $50 more than the QC35 II and the\xc2\xa0Sony WH-1000XM3, CNET's current top-rated noise-canceling headphone. (The latter has recently sold for $300 or less, in fact.) But leaving aside the debate over the new design and higher price tag for a moment, I'll say this: The Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 sound and perform better than their predecessor, and shine as a headset for making calls.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0""b'To be clear, this really is a new headphone, both on the outside and the inside, with new drivers and a total of eight microphones to help enable Bose\'s ""evolved  noise-canceling functionality."" One of the biggest external changes is to the headband. The QuietComfort 35 II has a high-tech resin (read: plastic) headband, while the Headphones 700\'s headband incorporates a single, seamless piece of stainless steel that seemingly makes it a little sturdier. However, as a result of the new design, there\'s no hinge, so they don\'t fold up, just flat, and you simply lay them into their protective carrying case, which is larger than the QuietComfort 35 II\'s case.'b'The headband is reinforced with a seamless piece of stainless steel.'b""Some will like that you don't have to bother folding the headphones while others will prefer the predecessor's smaller case. I did like that there's a little compartment in the case -- its door closes magnetically -- for storing the USB-C charging cable and the short cable for wired listening. It's worth noting that the port on the headphone is the smaller 2.5mm variety so, bizarrely, it's a 2.5mm to 3.5mm cable.""b'Read more:\xc2\xa0Bose Earbuds 500 are the AirPods killers worth waiting for'b""In the past, Bose has tried to shave weight off its headphones, but at 254g this model is actually about half an ounce heavier than the QuietComfort 35 II, which will remain in the line. You can feel the weight difference. Personally, I didn't find the headphone any less or more comfortable than the QuietComfort 35 II; it just felt a little different (I don't have a large head). But some other editors in our office thought the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 clamped down on their heads a little more forcefully than the Quiet Comfort 35 II, creating slightly more pressure.\xc2\xa0""b""The material on the inside of the headband is also different. The Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 have a soft-to-the-touch rubberized inside band that's filled with air for extra cushioning while the Quiet Comfort 35 II relies on foam padding covered in a fancy cloth material for its cushioning. The rubber doesn't absorb sweat, which is good, but some people will prefer the cloth and padding on the Quiet Comfort 35 II.""b""The long and short of it is the Noise Cancelling Headphones are comfortable, but the Quiet Comfort 35 II and the\xc2\xa0Sony WH-1000XM3\xc2\xa0arguably feel slightly better. On the other hand, the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 seems slightly more durable. That said, it's a good idea to store the headphones in their protective carrying case. The finish on the metal part of the band is a little susceptible to getting scratched up if they rub up against metal objects in a bag or backpack.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0""b""Bose is touting the headphone's voice communication features. While the overall sound quality is a relatively small step up from the QuietComfort 35 II -- more on that in a minute -- the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 perform significantly better as a headset for making calls. The new microphones are designed to pick up your voice better (some of them are beam-forming mics) and reduce noise around you so people can hear you better in noisier environments. That goes for voice assistants as well -- the headphone supports Siri, Google Assistant and Amazon's Alexa, all of which should better understand what you're saying in noisier environments. ""b""I made some calls from the noisy streets of New York and people could hear me even when I was standing next to a trash truck that was compacting old furniture outside our office building. The headphones do a really good job filtering out background noise. Not all of it, but a lot of it. When you're not talking, the headphones greatly reduce the ambient noise around you. However, when you speak, the headphones do let some background noise in because the microphones, even beamed into your voice, pick up some outside noise. Needless to say, the headphones' computer chips are doing a fair amount of sound processing.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""b""There's also an adjustable sidetone feature that allows you to hear your voice in the headphones (which prevents you from talking too loudly when on a call). The QuietComfort 35 II has some light sidetone that not everybody notices, but you can really sense it in this new model.\xc2\xa0""b""The headphones fold flat into their case. There's a small compartment for storing the cables. ""b'In Bose\'s Music companion app for iOS and Android, you designate which assistant you want to use and then access that assistant with a button push like you do on the QuietComfort 35 II. If you choose Alexa, you can activate Amazon\'s voice assistant by simply saying the wake word ""Alexa."" That makes this one of the few headphones to offer always-on Alexa and it performs about as well as the AirPods and Beats Powerbeats Pro do with always-on Siri. The\xc2\xa0Jabra Elite 85h, another headphone that\'s great for making calls and is equipped with lots of microphones, was supposed to have this feature but Jabra ended up leaving it off after it discovered that it had too great an impact on battery life.'b'Read more:\xc2\xa0Best headphones for 2019 'b""I asked a Bose rep about the possible adverse impact on battery life when using always-on Alexa because the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700's 20 hours of battery life is shorter than that of a lot of its competitors (a quick-charge feature does allow you to get 3.5 hours of battery life from a 15-minute charge). The rep said that it did not have an impact on battery life and that the battery life was the same whether you had Bluetooth on or off, say, if you were in wired mode on a plane. To that end, it's also worth noting that you can use the headphone in wired mode if the battery dies. It doesn't sound quite as good unplugged -- yes, I tried it -- but it still sounds pretty decent (the bass isn't as strong) and the headphones passively muffle a fair amount noise simply by virtue of being an over-ear model. ""b""This is the first Bose headphone equipped with touch controls. The touch area is on the right side of the right ear cup. I found that they worked well and that same Bose rep told me that Bose's engineers were aware of the problems that some Sony WH-1000XM3 users were having with that headphone's touch controls in cold weather and that the Noise Cancelling 700 Headphones had been tested in the cold. The touch controls supposedly work but we'll have to wait until winter to test it out ourselves.  """,8.7,b'David Carnoy',"July 24, 2019 4:00 a.m. PT"

They were not without some flaws, however. The buds' batteries would drain while in the case, so if you didn't charge the case for four days, you could end up with a dead set of earbuds, which was annoying. They were also a tad big, so some people complained of discomfort after having them in their ears for a while. And at $300, they were pretty pricey.""b""The second-generation Momentum True Wireless 2, available now for preorder and shipping in April, still have that elevated $300 (\xc2\xa3279; 300 euros) price. But they're better all around, with a slightly smaller, more comfortable design, active noise canceling that rivals that of the AirPod Pro, improved battery life (up to seven hours versus the original's four) and better noise reduction during calls. And, if you don't like them in black, a white version is slated to follow later this year. Most importantly, though, the Momentum True Wireless 2   have the same stellar sound -- for true wireless earbuds, anyway -- offering clearly superior sound quality to the AirPods Pro. That makes them arguably the best true wireless earbuds on the market today and earns them a CNET Editors' Choice Award.""b""That said, they're not necessarily for everybody. Aside from the fact that they're expensive -- $50 more than the AirPods Pro -- they're heavier, not quite as comfortable to wear and lack the hands-free Siri found on those Apple models. And, while Sennheiser shrank the new earbuds by 2mm, the Momentum True Wireless 2 are still on the bigger side and may not be a perfect match for some people's ears. Personally, they fit my ears quite well and I got a tight seal from the largest ear tip (three sizes are included). As I said, I felt that the slightly smaller design does help -- I was able to wear these without a problem for long stretches.""b'Read more:\xc2\xa0The best true wireless earbuds of 2020'b'That tight seal is crucial for optimizing sound quality and noise cancellation. The AirPods Pro have adaptive noise canceling. The noise canceling on the Momentum True Wireless 2   doesn\'t seem to be adaptive, but it is effective. In the settings menu, it says, ""Single-mic ANC reduces low-frequency ambient noise,"" adding that activating the feature does have an ""impact on battery life."" In other words, don\'t expect to get seven hours if you have it on, particularly if you play your music at higher volumes. The charging case does provide an extra three charges (21 hours) on the go and Sennheiser has fixed the issue with the buds\' battery draining in the case -- they now go into a deep sleep mode.\xc2\xa0'b'The buds are 2mm smaller than the originals and the case is a darker shade of gray.'b""I wore the Momentum True Wireless 2 around the streets of New York and in the subway for a couple of days. You get some passive noise cancellation from just getting a tight seal, but when I toggled the noise canceling on and off while riding the subway, the difference was immediately apparent. It seemed to be on par with the AirPods Pro's noise canceling for muffling ambient noise. I didn't try them on a plane, but I think they would be good for that environment as well.""b'Read more:\xc2\xa0Best-sounding wireless earbuds: Sony, Sennheiser and more compared'b""Like the originals, these have touch controls and they work well, although I like Apple's stem-squeezing controls on the AirPods Pro a little better. You can program the touch controls in Sennheiser's Smart Control app for iOS and Android. For instance, I set the tap-and-hold gesture on the right earbud to activate noise canceling. The same gesture on the left earbud activates a transparency mode that allows ambient sound in so you can have a conversation while wearing them.""b""Sennheiser isn't marketing these as sports earphones, but with an IPX4 rating they are splashproof and should be sweatproof. I was able to go running without them falling out of my ears and they're certainly fine for lighter workouts at the gym. I can't tell you how well they'll hold up over time if you sweat on them a lot, but they should be able to put up with some moisture without a problem.""b""Like the originals, the earbuds have volume controls on the earbuds themselves using the default tap-and-hold gesture. However, after I changed the tap-and-hold gesture to activate ANC -- instead of control volume -- I couldn't change the gesture back to controlling volume (I had to reset the controls back to their default settings). The app I was using was labeled as beta, and I assume this bug will be fixed in an update. \xc2\xa0""b'The earbuds are still a little bit on the large side, but they fit more comfortably.'b""A couple of other settings are worth mentioning. You can choose to activate sidetone, a feature I like that allows you to hear your voice in the earbuds and modulate your voice when you're making a call. And there is an equalizer in the app to tweak bass and treble levels to your liking. For purposes of this review I left it at the default setting, which seemed perfectly good to me.\xc2\xa0""b""Sennheiser added a microphone to each earbud for the noise canceling and there's a beamforming microphone in each earbud to pick up your voice when making calls or using your voice assistant. The call performance is improved from the originals', with better noise reduction so people can hear you better in noisy environments (ambient noise is muffled though still present). I'm not sure these are quite as good as the AirPods when it comes to call quality, but they performed well overall in this department.""b""I also experienced minimal Bluetooth hiccups -- the wireless connection was mostly solid. They use Bluetooth 5.1, with support for AAC and aptX audio codes (only certain Android phones support aptX streaming). And I didn't have any problems with audio syncing correctly when watching video apps like Netflix, YouTube and Vudu.""b'The case has USB-C but not wireless charging.'b""The Momentum True Wireless 2 earbuds have the same 7mm dynamic drivers as the originals. If there are some slight gains in sound quality, it's more likely due to better digital processing as a result of chip and software upgrades. As I said, sound quality is excellent and the Momentum True Wireless 2 has richer, more detailed sound than the AirPods Pro with well-defined bass, natural-sounding mids and some sparkle in the treble. These sound like premium headphones should. They're pretty open; the sound doesn't feel stuck in your head.""b""I rated the\xc2\xa0Sony WF-1000XM3\xc2\xa0earbuds highly for sound, though they're not great for making calls. The Momentum True Wireless 2 are a little more detailed and articulate. On well-recorded tracks you can really hear each instrument; they don't blend in with each like with a lot of Bluetooth headphones. Other high-end models like the Master & Dynamic MW07 Plus ($300) also have smooth, nicely detailed sound with good bass definition, as well as some noise cancellation, but the True Wireless 2 have better design and headset performance along with slightly better sound and more effective noise cancellation.\xc2\xa0""b""The case charges via USB-C, whereas at this price you'd like to see wireless charging, but that's not a major omission. The AirPods Pro certainly have an appealing design and feature set with strong performance, but they're simply not in the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2's league for sound quality. And now that Sennheiser has added active noise canceling and fixed some of the original Momentum True Wireless' small flaws, these are the earbuds to get if you value sound quality over everything else.\xc2\xa0""",9.2,b'David Carnoy',"March 13, 2020 12:47 p.m. PT"
b'Bose SoundSport Wireless',b'Headphones',CNET,b'Bose SoundSport Wireless review:\xc2\xa0The Bluetooth sports headphone to beat',"b'Over the years I frequently get asked what the best Bluetooth sports headphone is. My stock answer is that none are perfect, all have their drawbacks, and the handful of top models may fit you well and work great -- or they may not.'b""Bose's SoundSport Wireless, the company's first Bluetooth sports headphone, isn't perfect either, but it may just be the best Bluetooth sports headphone currently out there.""b""What makes it the best? Well, it's very comfortable to wear, sounds good, seems well built, and -- at $150, \xc2\xa3140 or AU$249 -- it isn't outrageously priced. ""b'Like the original SoundSport wired, which remains in the line and gets a price chop from $130 to $100, this new SoundSport Wireless  has an open design. By open, I mean you don\'t jam the earbud into your ear and completely seal off your ear canal (that type of headphone is referred to as a ""noise-isolating"" in-ear headphone). Thanks to Bose\'s StayHear+  eartips, which come in three sizes -- small, medium, large -- the bud sits loosely in your ear yet  remains securely in place. 'b'The SoundSport Wireless comes with three sizes of StayHear ear tips.'b""This model is equipped with a special sport version of the StayHear tips that's different from the StayHear tips included with Bose's earlier in-ear headphones, so they aren't interchangeable. I should also point out that because the earpieces extend out from your ears you'll probably have some trouble wearing these under certain helmets.""b""The ear pieces are somewhat bulky, but not so bulky to feel heavy on your ears. However, if there's a criticism of this headphone's design, it's that the ear pieces could protrude out a little less and be more discrete-looking. Easier said then done, of course -- today's battery technology is holding back miniaturization efforts.""b""Rival headphones -- such as Jaybird's X2 and Freedom, Beats' Powerbeats 2 Wireless and Monster's Adidas Sport Adistar -- give you the ability to shorten the cord length (or cinch up the cord) for those who want to wear the cord closer to the neck. With this headphone, you can't adjust the cord length, but what Bose has done is provide a clip you can hook on to the back of your shirt (at the top) to keep the cord from flopping about. It's a smart design and I thought it worked well; the cord remained fairly stable, even while I was running.""b'The headphone comes in aqua and black colors at launch with yellow arriving in September.'b""The only downside to the floating-fit, open design is that ambient sound  does leak in: this isn't a great headphone for noisy environments. (If that's your preference, Bose's upcoming QuietControl 30 is a wireless model that features active noise-canceling.) But if you're out running or biking, you'll be able to hear cars coming,  which is why a lot of runners and bikers prefer their headphones to  have open designs.""b""As you might expect, the headphone is sweat- and water-resistant and there's an inline mic and remote that lets you skip songs, adjust volume, and take and make calls. Bose is touting its quality as a headset for making calls, as well as how reliable the Bluetooth connection is. I can attest to experiencing only minimal Bluetooth hiccups and was satisfied with how it performed as a headset, though the QuietControl 30 and QuietComfort 35 offer superior headset performance. Those models have noise-reduction features that muffle ambient sound, including wind and street noise.""b'Just as importantly I had no trouble pairing and repairing the headphone with my iPhone 6S and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (the Bose features near-field communication tap-to-pair technology for devices like the Samsung that support this feature). I also simultaneously paired it with my iPhone 6S and MacBook Air and had no trouble switching between the two when a call came in as I was watching a video on the computer.'b""Bose Connect, a free app for Android and iOS, allows you to manage your pairing list, upgrade the firmware and change the auto power off settings (the headphone powers down if you don't use it for a certain length of time, which is a good battery-saving feature). When you turn on the headphones, a female voice alerts you how much battery life is remaining and with which devices you're paired. That information is also available in the app.""b""At launch, the  headphone is available in two colors -- black and aqua -- with citron (yellow) coming in September.  Also in September, Bose is releasing the SoundSport Pulse Wireless, which costs $200 (\xc2\xa3170, AU$299) and has an integrated heart-rate monitor that's compatible with Runkeeper, Endomondo and other fitness apps.""",8.6,b'David Carnoy',"Sept. 26, 2016 9:55 p.m. PT"

If you get a comfortable, snug fit with a tight seal from one of the four different sized included silicon tips, you'll probably love these headphones and feel OK about dropping $250 (\xc2\xa3220, $AU350) on them. End up with something less than that and you may question their worth.""b""I came close to getting a great fit. I would rate it between a B+ and A-. The issue wasn't one of security; I never had to worry about them falling off. With a few tweaks to the iconic earhooks -- they're bendable -- the Powerbeats Pros were essentially clipped onto my ears. I shot some hoops with them on and I suspect that they'd stay on even if I was capable of, say, a 360-degree slam dunk. (Alas, I am not.)""b'Read more: The best true wireless headphones you can buy in 2019'b'The Powerbeats Pro in black.'b""My little problem: Even with the largest ear tips (yes, they're large but not quite large enough), my ear canal wasn't completely sealed off, so more ambient noise leaked in than I would have liked and sound quality was impacted in noisier environments -- like on the subway or the streets of New York. I was in the minority, however. I had CNET colleagues who were able to get a tight seal and not only really liked the fit but were immediately impressed with the sound.""b""These did fit me better and more comfortably than the earlier Powerbeats3 Wireless, which -- unlike the Pro -- have a wire connecting the left and right earbud. And, in fact, the Powerbeats Pro have been engineered to be compatible with a higher percentage of ears than past Powerbeats. That's because Beats, which is owned by Apple, refined their exterior design. According to Beats, the Powerbeats Pro are  23% smaller than the Powerbeats3 and 17%  lighter. They're  not rated as being fully waterproof, but they are  sweat- and water-resistant. With an IPX4 certification, they can be splashed from any direction but could fail if sprayed with a sustained jet of water or are fully submerged.\xc2\xa0  ""b'The Powerbeats Pro will initially ship in black, with other colors (white, navy and moss) available later this summer.'b""One thing that's definitely not compact is the charging case.

It'll leave a pretty big bulge in your pocket, so you'll probably want to  leave it in a bag or locker at the gym.

I liked the Galaxy Buds, I said, but I thought they were lacking in a couple of areas: They sounded decent for their price -- but not great -- and they just weren't good for making calls in noisier environments because callers complained about hearing too much background noise. ""b""But now Samsung gets a do-over in the form of the Galaxy Buds Plus, which have launched alongside the company's new Galaxy S20\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0Galaxy Z Flip\xc2\xa0smartphones. The new Buds Plus look essentially the same as the originals, but they have some improvements on the inside that boost performance significantly: Their battery life is rated at 11 hours for music playback (up from six), and they pack improved drivers for better sound and an additional microphone in each bud to help with external noise reduction while making calls.""b""At $150 (\xc2\xa3159, AU$299), they cost $20 more than the\xc2\xa0Galaxy Buds. And they're not bundled with Samsung's new phones, but the $150\xc2\xa0preorder credit with the Galaxy S20 Plus and S20 Ultra (when ordered via Samsung's site) effectively knocks the price down to free. Alas, while they feature the same noise-isolating design, they don't offer active noise cancellation like Apple's AirPods Pro do.\xc2\xa0""b""Available in three color options, black, light blue and white, the Galaxy Buds Plus have the same dimensions as their predecessors and look nearly identical. However, they weigh 6.3 grams (0.2 ounce), or 0.7 gram more than the Buds. That's because they have a larger battery and two-way drivers, with a woofer and tweeter, as opposed to a single driver. The battery case, which charges via USB-C and wirelessly with any Qi-compatible charging pad, is also equipped with a larger battery -- a three-minute charge in the case gives you one hour of juice. And yes, all of those new Samsung phones have the Wireless PowerShare feature, so you can top off your Galaxy Buds Plus just by resting the case on the phone's backside.""b""The other noteworthy changes are multidevice pairing -- an often overlooked feature that many people appreciate -- and an iOS app geared to make the Galaxy Buds Plus more friendly to iPhone ($699 at Apple) owners. At launch, the app garnered many negative reviews from current Galaxy Buds owners because it doesn't appear to be compatible with the original Galaxy Buds. But I thought the app was fine.""b'The app gives iOS users access to firmware upgrades, EQ settings for tweaking the buds\' sound and ""ambient sound"" settings that allow you to adjust the buds\' transparency levels (off, medium or high), letting sound in from the outside world into the buds. In the app, you can also opt to have ambient sound on when making calls. That allows you to hear your voice in the earbuds while talking. (This is sometimes referred to as Sidetone.) \xc2\xa0'b'Android users use Samsung\'s Galaxy Wearable app and get a few small features not available to iOS users, the biggest of which are one-touch Spotify access from the buds themselves and a gaming mode to ""minimize audio delay for vivid, synchronized gaming sound."" I used the buds with an iPhone 11 Pro and a\xc2\xa0Galaxy S9 Plus ($250 at Back Market). 'b'The Galaxy Buds Plus keep the same touch controls as the Buds. They work well and are quite responsive, although my double-taps to advance a track forward sometimes turned into triple taps that ended up restarting the track I was listening to (you triple-tap to skip back one track). In the app, you get some options for customizing the touch controls, including adjusting volume with a long press. There\'s even an ""experimental"" setting that enables you to use the edge of the buds for volume and the center for other controls. 'b""The Galaxy Buds fit my ears well, and the Galaxy Buds Plus felt very similar in my ears. These are pretty compact buds (they stick out from your ears a little, similar to Jabra's Elite 75t) and should fit most ears well. The only issue I had was with the ear tips. With these types of noise-isolating earphones it's crucial to get a tight seal to get optimal sound quality. I got a pretty good seal with the largest of the included tips, but things improved when I switched to my own ear tips. (One of the advantages of reviewing a lot of headphones is that I have a lot of ear tips lying around.) The ones I used were rounder and little wider than the included tips, which should work fine for many people's ears. The Samsung tips -- three sizes are included -- are a little more convex.\xc2\xa0 ""b'I opted to use the middle-size wing tip (three sizes are included) and got a nice secure fit. Although these have only IPX2 water-resistance, they are sweat-resistant (to a degree) and can be used at the gym and for running. That said, competing models like the Jabra Elite 75t (IPX5) offer higher water-resistance ratings and some are fully waterproof.\xc2\xa0 'b'I was impressed with the sound. It\'s detailed and smooth, with deep, well-defined bass. The sound is richer and more spacious than that of the original Galaxy Buds. Well-respected Austrian audio company AKG, which Samsung acquired when it bought Harman, is behind the audio. While the original Buds were also ""tuned"" by AKG, these are a nice upgrade over the originals -- and right there with what you get with the Jabra Elite 75t, if not even a touch better. Like many headphones these days, there is a little presence boost to help make your music sound more detailed and exciting, but which leads to some faint sibilance in the highs. You can toggle between a few EQ settings -- Soft, Bass Boost, Dynamic, Clear and Treble Boost -- but I stuck mostly with the Normal EQ setting, which seemed the most balanced. 'b'The buds look the same as their predecessors but weigh slightly more, thanks to new components on the inside.'b""Aside from the better battery life, the other performance enhancement you'll most appreciate is the call quality. The added external microphone for better noise reduction during calls helps correct the earphones' biggest weakness. The Galaxy Buds may not work quite as well as the AirPods Pro or Anker Liberty Air 2 for making calls, but they're significantly improved in this area from the original Galaxy Buds. In our test calls from the New York streets, external noise from traffic was effectively reduced and my voice could be heard clearly. ""b""I'll also add that my wireless connection remained rock-solid during my two days of testing. New York can be notoriously difficult on true wireless earbuds with interference issues, but I didn't experience any dropouts or glitches. I also didn't notice any problem with audio syncing when using various video streaming apps (including YouTube, Netflix and DisneyPlus). \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ""b'Ultimately, I don\'t think these will slow the sales of AirPods, but the Galaxy Buds have only become a better option for Android users and may even earn some fans who use iOS devices. Hopefully, they\'ll come down in price a bit -- I would have liked to have seen the original Galaxy Buds go to $99 and have these priced at $129.

Jabra says the 75t\'s drivers are the same as those of the 65t, but the smaller design will help more people get a more comfortable, snugger fit. That snug fit (""tight seal"" I sometimes call it) is not only crucial to having the buds stay in your ears securely but it allows you to get the best sound out of them with improved bass performance. And these do have very good sound quality for true wireless if you can get that tight seal. (To be clear, I am comparing these to other true wireless earbuds, not wired headphones, which tend to deliver better sound for the money).\xc2\xa0'b'The new design didn\'t make a huge difference for me in terms of fit. As I said, the Elite 65t basically fit my ears almost perfectly and these do, too, passively sealing out a good amount of ambient noise. However, the Elite 75t are definitely lighter and more discreet. The ""pipe"" of the earbuds, where the voice microphone lives, has almost been eliminated on the Elite 75t and its absence gives the earbuds a more streamlined look. That\'s a big deal. And I think the new smaller design will not only fit more ears but fit them more comfortably. It\'s arguably not quite as comfortable as the AIrPods Pro, which is slightly lighter, but it\'s comfortable for this type of noise-isolating in-ear headphone, which isn\'t for everybody (many people don\'t like having a silicone ear tip dipped into their ear canal). \xc2\xa0'b'The Elite 65t (left) vs. the Elite 75t (right).'b""I also appreciated the smaller charging case and that it now has a flat bottom so you can lay it down horizontally (you have to stand the Elite 65t's case up vertically). These design upgrades may seem small but they clearly improve the product. ""b""The headphones still have four microphones -- two in each earbud -- but the location has changed. There are now microphones at the front and the back of each bud. The Elite 65t worked well as a headset and this model works a little better for making calls, though I did think that both the AirPods Pro and Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 were a notch up with their noise reduction in noisier environments. You can use the  right earbud alone for mono music playback or for calls. If you remove  the left earbud while you're listening to music, the music will  automatically pause.   To resume mono playback in the right earbud, you have to press the multifunction  button. ""b'With the Elite 75t, callers said they could hear me clearly but the background sound was less muffled than with the AirPods Pro and the Anker. The Liberty Air 2 actually was the best at muffling background sound. All that said, the Elite 75t is the only one of the three to have a sidetone feature that allows you hear your own voice in the earphones (that keeps you from talking too loudly). You can adjust the level of sidetone in the app.'b'The Jabra Elite 75t are equipped with Bluetooth 5.0, which not only helps improve battery life, but also helps with wireless connectivity. I experienced almost no Bluetooth hiccups in the New York City, which is notoriously difficult on true wireless earbuds, particularly last-generation models. While the earbuds are smaller battery life is now rated at 7.5 hours at moderate volume levels -- up from 5 hours on the Elite 65t (the AirPods Pro are rated at 4.5 hours with noise canceling on). The case provides an additional 20.5 hours of battery life. My initial tests indicate the battery life numbers are accurate -- at least for the buds themselves.\xc2\xa0'b""With an IP55 water-resistance rating, the Elite 75t is splashproof and offers some dust resistance and will be fine to use at the gym and for running (the buds stayed in my ears securely while running). Like the Elite 65t, there's a HearThrough transparency mode that lets ambient sound -- you activate it with a short press on the left earbud -- and in the Sound+ app for iOS and Android you can opt to have your music pause when you active HearThrough. That way if someone comes up to talk to you with the buds on, you can tap the left earbud and have a conversation.\xc2\xa0""b'The app also has EQ settings that allow you to tweak the sound to your liking and you can choose between your device\'s native voice assistant or Amazon\'s Alexa voice assistant. However, you have to press a button to access the voice assistant (to be clear, these buds have physical buttons). With the AirPods Pro, you can simply say, ""Hey, Siri"" to access Siri hands-free.\xc2\xa0'b'Unlike the AirPods Pro, these have volume controls on the buds. You press and hold the button on the left earbud to lower volume and press and hold the button on the right earbud to raise the volume. It works well.'b'The earphones have a more discreet design.'b'Tweaking the EQ settings can improve the sound quality a bit. I ended up going with the ""Smooth"" setting, which reduces the treble a bit and elevates the bass slightly. That setting seemed to work well for a variety of musical genres. And while the Elite 75t may not be quite as comfortable as the AirPods Pro and doesn\'t perform quite as well as a headset for making calls, I think it sounds better than the AirPods Pro. They offer better overall clarity, with better definition in the bass. They\'re more lively and dynamic.\xc2\xa0'b""For some people, that superior sound may not trump the pluses of the AirPods Pro. But the Elite 75t does cost $70 less and hopefully will dip closer to $150 in time. It's an all-around excellent set of true wireless earbuds that has enough improvements, including a significantly improved design and better battery life, to make it one of the top models in this highly competitive and quickly evolving headphone category.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""",8.5,b'David Carnoy',"Nov. 14, 2019 8:30 a.m. PT"

Like that model, after you wear them for a while, your ear canals may start to itch a little. Not to get too graphic, but I simply removed the bud for a moment, stuck my pinky finger in my ear for a quick scratch, then reinserted the bud. Problem solved. \xc2\xa0'b'Technically, the Elite 65t is not considered a sports model, though its IP55-rated design makes it splash-resistant and dust-resistant. I used the standard Elite 65t at the gym and while running and it survived just fine.

Currently, you can use the accelerometer -- Jabra calls it a motion sensor -- to count steps in Jabra's companion Sound+ app for iOS and Android. However, there should be other applications for it, such as counting exercise reps, in the future.""b""Both the Elite 65t and Elite Active 65t are equipped with Bluetooth 5.0, which is just starting to appear in devices and is supposed to create a more stable wireless connection with fewer dropouts. It's backwards compatible with any earlier version of Bluetooth, too, of course.""b""I'm a fan of the AirPods, but they don't sit quite securely enough in my ears, which means I can't use them for running or during other sporty activities. Lots of people are able to run with their AirPods, just not me. As I said, the Elite 65t gave a much more secure fit.""b""The Jabras are noise-isolating earphones, which means they passively seal out ambient noise while the AirPods' open design allows sound to leak in.

But its successor, the Jaybird Vista (cue the Windows Vista jokes), includes design and performance improvements that make it the product I\'d hoped the Run would be.'b""At $180 (\xc2\xa3160, AU$280), it's a little more expensive than it should be, but it's one of the better true wireless headphones to hit the market in 2019. It will appeal to those looking for a more discreet set of totally wireless sports headphones that offers full waterproofing.""b'The Jaybird Vista will eventually come in three color options (black is currently available).\xc2\xa0'b'They fit very securely.'",8.0,b'David Carnoy',"July 31, 2019 12:01 a.m. PT"
